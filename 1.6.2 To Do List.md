# To do before v1.6.2 is released

(Please strike anything that has been completed. And put your handle by
it so we know who to thank\!)

## Tasks

(in no particular order)

  - Merge the Features\_MIDIScriptAutoReaction branch to trunk
    (currently waiting on the Qt team to see if our solution is a good
    one)
  - ~~Fix the version number in defs.h and all MIDI XML files~~ done by
    Pegasus and Mad Jester
  - ~~Port old MIDI XML device files to the [new
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format) (basically just adding
    a header block.)~~ done by Mad Jester
  - Complete MIDI device selection & mapping dialog
  - Simple front tab: select MIDI device, pick the corresponding
    mapping, and done
  - Or select MIDI device, auto select the mapping (a simple table
    should be all that's needed)
  - MidiInputMappingTableView - add delegate classes
  - Display the MidiType (Key/CC/etc) (instead of those crappy
    enumerated integers)
  - Combo boxes
  - Values display in hexadecimal
  - MIDI output handling
  - Create MidiOutputMappingTableModel and -View
  - Write underlying data structure for output (OutputMidiMapping)
  - Clear up as many compiler warnings as we can (give preference to the
    "depreciated function" ones so we don't get bitten later.)
