# To do before v1.6.2 is released

(Please strike anything that has been completed. And put your handle by
it so we know who to thank\!)

Development of 1.6.2 has been moved to a Bzr branch. See this for usage
details:
<https://code.launchpad.net/~mixxxdevelopers/mixxx/release-1.6.2>

## Tasks

Most important ones:

  - Fix model issue where removing any row removes the last row as well.
    (midiinputmappingtablemodel.cpp, midimapping.cpp)
  - Fix model issue where completing the learning wizard doesn't list
    anything in the table until Mixxx is restarted (probably same as
    above)
  - Get rid of MidiType enum, switch MIDI mapping format to use
    \<status\> for input blocks as well. (Albert probably)
  - Non-C++ task: Get the "res" directory to copy to the proper place
    (`prefix=`) on an `scons install` (python)
  - Multithreading guru task: Clean up and check MidiScriptEngine
    thread-safety
  - **Non-coding task:** Test mono MP3/OGG/FLAC/WAVs
  - **Non-coding task:** Test everything in different versions of
    Windows, particularly Windows-only bugs
  - **Non-coding task:** [Test MIDI
    mappings](Supported%20Controller%20Test%20Grid) for correct
    functionality for as many currently supported controllers as we can

Other tasks (in no particular order):

  - ~~Merge the Features\_MIDIScriptAutoReaction branch to trunk
    (currently waiting on the Qt team to see if our solution is a good
    one)~~ - RRyan and Pegasus
  - ~~Fix the version number in defs.h and all MIDI XML files~~ -
    Pegasus and Mad Jester
  - ~~Port old MIDI XML device files to the [new
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format) (basically just adding
    a header block.)~~ - Mad Jester
  - ~~Complete MIDI device selection & mapping dialog (see the
    [MidiMapping design
    spec](midi_scripting#midi_mapping_object_design_spec))~~
  - ~~Use tree view in preferences and display MIDI devices on left.~~ -
    gamegod
  - ~~Or select MIDI device, auto select the mapping (combobox)~~ -
    gamegod
  - ~~Reimplement MIDI Learning~~ (100% done - gamegod)
  - ~~Rewrite midiEvent() signal in MidiObject to emit a MidiMessage,
    and rename the signal to midiLearn()~~
  - ~~Connect midiLearn() signal to some learn() slot in MidiMapping
    object~~
  - ~~Write learn() slot in MidiMapping. learn() should update the
    mapping and emit(inputMappingChanged()) at the end.~~
  - \<del\>Create list of usable controls... \</del\> - gamegod
  - ~~Midi Scripting~~
  - ~~Clear scripting engine when new MIDI mapping preset is loaded in
    the Prefs.~~ - gamegod
  - MidiInputMappingTableView - add delegate classes
  - ~~Display the MidiType (Key/CC/etc) (instead of those crappy
    enumerated integers)~~ - gamegod
  - ~~Combo boxes for group and control~~ - gamegod
  - Values display in hexadecimal
  - Handle MIDI Pitch input messages (0xE0, MSB, LSB)
  - MIDI output handling (probably same model issue as above) :-)
  - ~~Create MidiOutputMappingTableModel~~ ~~and -View~~ - gamegod
  - ~~Write underlying data structure for output (OutputMidiMapping)~~ -
    Pegasus
  - Finish adding delegate classes and finish up output table (include
    correct columns)
  - Fix up \<status\> and \<miditype\> mishandling in MidiMessage for
    outputs
  - Clear up as many compiler warnings as we can ~~(give preference to
    the "depreciated function" ones so we don't get bitten later.)~~
    (kousu)
  - Fix the segfault-on-close that's happening on linux with intel
    graphics drivers 
  - ~~Call MIDI script init function when opening the device, not
    before~~ - Pegasus
  - ~~Call MIDI script shutdown function (if one exists) just before
    closing the device~~ - Pegasus
  - Test everything on Windows, since many issues are Windows-specific.
    (The MSVC-compiled version of Mixxx is the official one.) [Compiling
    on Windows](compiling_on_windows)
  - ~~Write an upgrade function that moves mixxx.cfg and mixxxtrack.xml
    to their new homes (ffs)~~ - Pegasus

## Known Issues / Errata

  - Master VU meter is unaffected by Balance control (but the audio
    responds correctly)
