# To do before v1.6.2 is released

(Please strike anything that has been completed. And put your handle by
it so we know who to thank\!)

## Tasks

(in no particular order)

  - ~~Merge the Features\_MIDIScriptAutoReaction branch to trunk
    (currently waiting on the Qt team to see if our solution is a good
    one)~~ - RRyan and Pegasus
  - ~~Fix the version number in defs.h and all MIDI XML files~~ -
    Pegasus and Mad Jester
  - ~~Port old MIDI XML device files to the [new
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format) (basically just adding
    a header block.)~~ - Mad Jester
  - Complete MIDI device selection & mapping dialog (see the
    [MidiMapping design
    spec](midi_scripting#midi_mapping_object_design_spec))
  - ~~Use tree view in preferences and display MIDI devices on left.~~ -
    gamegod
  - Simple use: select MIDI device, pick the corresponding mapping, and
    done
  - Or select MIDI device, auto select the mapping (combobox)
  - Reimplement MIDI Learning (90% done - gamegod)
  - ~~Rewrite midiEvent() signal in MidiObject to emit a MidiMessage,
    and rename the signal to midiLearn()~~
  - ~~Connect midiLearn() signal to some learn() slot in MidiMapping
    object~~
  - ~~Write learn() slot in MidiMapping. learn() should update the
    mapping and emit(inputMappingChanged()) at the end.~~
  - Create list of usable controls... 

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Won't res/midi/BindableConfigKeys.txt work? -S
    * No, that list sucks because it still includes a lot of obscure unused controls. What I need is a list of the basic controls present on Mixxx's default UI. I'll steal these from the X-Session Pro mapping, since it includes almost all the basics. I also need short, human-readable explanations of what each control does. - Albert 
* MidiInputMappingTableView - add delegate classes
* <del>Display the MidiType (Key/CC/etc) (instead of those crappy enumerated integers)</del> - gamegod
* Combo boxes for group and control
* Values display in hexadecimal
* Handle MIDI Pitch input messages (0xE0, MSB, LSB)
* MIDI output handling
* <del>Create MidiOutputMappingTableModel</del> <del>and -View</del> - gamegod
* <del>Write underlying data structure for output (OutputMidiMapping)</del> - Pegasus
* Finish adding delegate classes and finish up output table (include correct columns)
* Clean up and make MidiScriptEngine thread-safe
* Address any FIXMEs. (Those displayed at runtime at least.)
* Clear up as many compiler warnings as we can (give preference to the "depreciated function" ones so we don't get bitten later.) (In progress - kousu)
* Fix mono oggs (and test mono-everythings)
* Fix the segfault-on-close that's happening on linux with intel graphics drivers 
* Correct Cue + Play functionality in the Mixxx core. (Pressing both together should play from that point on.)
* <del>Call MIDI script init function when opening the device, not before</del> - Pegasus
* <del>Call MIDI script shutdown function (if one exists) just before closing the device</del> - Pegasus
* [[compiling_on_windows|Windows compilation]] issues (if time allows, otherwise we must require MSVC++ 2005 redist)
