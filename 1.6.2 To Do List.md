# To do before v1.6.2 is released

(Please strike anything that has been completed. And put your handle by
it so we know who to thank\!)

## Tasks

(in no particular order)

  - ~~Merge the Features\_MIDIScriptAutoReaction branch to trunk
    (currently waiting on the Qt team to see if our solution is a good
    one)~~ - RRyan and Pegasus
  - ~~Fix the version number in defs.h and all MIDI XML files~~ -
    Pegasus and Mad Jester
  - ~~Port old MIDI XML device files to the [new
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format) (basically just adding
    a header block.)~~ - Mad Jester
  - Complete MIDI device selection & mapping dialog (see the
    [MidiMapping design
    spec](midi_scripting#midi_mapping_object_design_spec))
  - ~~Use tree view in preferences and display MIDI devices on left.~~ -
    gamegod
  - Simple use: select MIDI device, pick the corresponding mapping, and
    done
  - Or select MIDI device, auto select the mapping (a simple table
    should be all that's needed)
  - Reimplement MIDI Learning (90% done - gamegod)
  - ~~Rewrite midiEvent() signal in MidiObject to emit a MidiMessage,
    and rename the signal to midiLearn()~~
  - ~~Connect midiLearn() signal to some learn() slot in MidiMapping
    object~~
  - ~~Write learn() slot in MidiMapping. learn() should update the
    mapping and emit(inputMappingChanged()) at the end.~~
  - Create list of usable controls...
  - MidiInputMappingTableView - add delegate classes
  - ~~Display the MidiType (Key/CC/etc) (instead of those crappy
    enumerated integers)~~ - gamegod
  - Combo boxes for group and control
  - Values display in hexadecimal
  - Handle MIDI Pitch input messages (0xE0, MSB, LSB)
  - MIDI output handling
  - ~~Create MidiOutputMappingTableModel~~ ~~and -View~~ - gamegod
  - ~~Write underlying data structure for output (OutputMidiMapping)~~ -
    Pegasus
  - Finish adding delegate classes and finish up output table (include
    correct columns)
  - Clean up and make MidiScriptEngine thread-safe
  - Address any FIXMEs. (Those displayed at runtime at least.)
  - Clear up as many compiler warnings as we can (give preference to the
    "depreciated function" ones so we don't get bitten later.) (In
    progress - kousu)
  - Fix mono oggs (and test mono-everythings)
  - Fix the segfault-on-close that's happening on linux with intel
    graphics drivers 
  - Correct Cue + Play functionality in the Mixxx core. (Pressing both
    together should play from that point on.)
  - ~~Call MIDI script init function when opening the device, not
    before~~ - Pegasus
  - ~~Call MIDI script shutdown function (if one exists) just before
    closing the device~~ - Pegasus
  - [Windows compilation](compiling_on_windows) issues (if time allows,
    otherwise we must require MSVC++ 2005 redist)
