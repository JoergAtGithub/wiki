# Things to do for v1.8.0

  - Library: Complete the rewrite for basic -- but stable --
    functionality
  - Looping: Complete the [looping](looping) feature
  - Vinyl control: Integrate the latest xwax release code
  - MIDI scripting:
  - Add MIDI script timers (using QTimer)
  - Pass the \<group\> value from the XML to the script as an additional
    parameter (at the end of the list so existing scripts are not
    affected.)
  - Add a way to pass extra parameters from the MIDI mapping to the
    script function ?
  - PortMIDI Branch:
  - ~~Move all PortMIDI calls to one thread (the script engines can not
    directly call send\*Msg anymore.)~~ [See
    this.](http://lists.create.ucsb.edu/pipermail/media_api/2005-September/000422.html)
    (DONE)
  - ~~Save multiple device files correctly, deleting previous .midi.xml
    files in .mixxx/~~ (DONE)

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Save 'Only' Enabled MIDI devices
    * Save the Metadata (author, description, etc...)
    * Find a more appropriate place to save the files other than the MidiDeviceManager destructor
* <del>Load those files correctly</del> (DONE)
* GUI changes:
    * Make "Activate"/"Enable" button toggleable (When active, change it to "Disable" and display "ENABLED" text above it)
    * Display enabled devices in the tree in bold text
    * Auto-change "Output" drop-down based on auto-selected output device in MidiDevice(Manager) when the device is enabled
    * Make "Output" drop-down take effect when changed
    * Persistent mapping preset drop-down (don't return to "..." unless Clear All is pressed. If the user tweaks the mapping, say "<custom>" or something.)
    * Do not commit changes to the MIDI mapping tables unless OK is pressed in the preferences window. (I.e. allow pressing the Cancel button or the X on the preferences window to restore the MIDI mappings to their previous states.)
```
