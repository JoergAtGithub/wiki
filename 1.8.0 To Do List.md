# Things to do for v1.8.0

### Library

Complete the rewrite for basic -- but stable -- functionality

  - Track DB

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * <del>Needs blacklisting of removed songs.</del>
* 1.7.0 to 1.8.0 XML->DB Library importer (Zach)
* Searching across library features
    * <del>Make sure search is case-insensitive everywhere</del>
    * <del>Search is saved and restored per-model</del>
    * Playlist models store the search per-playlist
    * <del>Searches occur in background thread.</del>
* Drag-n-drop across library features
    * Make sure you can drop tracks from any place (browse, external track source, mixxx library) into a Mixxx playlist and the play queue
    * Win/Mac/Linux drag of files from OS file browser into Mixxx?
    * Make explicit the cases in which a file outside the Mixxx library is added to the Mixxx library.
* Context menus across the whole library 
    * Make sure context choices for tracks are appropriate to current state.
    * Menus for sidebar items
* UI Feedback  
    * When a track is missing from the library - Missing Songs model there, but buggy...
    * When a track failed to load
    * When your results are filtered (i.e. a search is active) 
    * When you are about to add a track to your Mixxx library. Make any warnings disable-able via mixxx.cfg.
* Browse Mode
    * <del>Use a file-system model that polls in a background thread</del>
    * <del>Searches and sorting for the filesystem view</del>
    * <del>Always show .. as a choice</del>
    * <del>Always sort folders before files</del>
    * Needs header that shows you your current path
    * Sorting doesn't work in Size column (kb/mb treated as the same)
* Playlists 
    * <del>Playlist table headers show raw column names</del>
    * <del>Playlists need duration delegate</del>
    * <del>Dragging a file thats in a playlist to its own playlist results in many added copies.</del>
    * <del>Drag-and-drop reordering</del>

    * <del>Basic fast hashing rescan</del>
    * <del>Modify Library table to make orphan detection easier later (add extra track_locations table)</del>
    * <del>Add mixxx_deleted to Libray table and fs_deleted cols to track_locations table</del>
    * <del>Use mixxx_deleted to blacklist files "removed" from the Mixxx library.</del>
    * <del>Cancel rescan functionality (just needs to be fixed)</del>
* Tagging (not file metadata tagging)
    * <del>DAO for tags</del>
    * <del>Feature for tags</del>
    * <del>Drag-n-drop to sidebar</del>
    * <del>Tag table model</del>
    * <del>Context menu for track table</del>
    * <del>Context menus for tags in sidebar</del>
    * Feature overview page
    * <del>Prepare view</del>
    * Delegate for showing tags in library table
* Track Sources
    * iTunes playlist TrackModel
    * iTunes needs duration delegate
    * Rhythmbox Need Date delegate
    * <del>Sorting doesn't work in XML-sourced Playlists</del>
* Polish
    * Sidebar icons for each feature
    * MIDI-control of Library
    * Tooltips for sidebar items
* Track-table column header context menu to show/hide columns
* Cue/Loop Storage in the DB - (this is really a mini-project in itself) 
    * <del>Write a CueDAO/Cue service.</del>
    * <del>Make TIO's have a list of Cue's</del>
    * <del>Make TrackCollection save a TIO's Cue's on track save (via CueDAO)</del>
    * <del>Ditch EngineBufferCue</del>
    * <del>Extend EngineBuffer to allow outside addition of EngineControls</del>
    * <del>Write CueControl, created by Player, added to EngineBuffer as an EngineControl</del>
    * <del>Restore track-editor, make it show hotcues</del>
    * Add custom widgets for hotcues -- not happening: skins will have to have hacked buttons instead
    * <del>Waveform / waveform overview loops and cues</del>
    * <del>Update skins</del>
* Minor Bugs
    * <del>Duration Delegate should format seconds as %02d.</del> 
    * <del>Sorting is not case insensitive (e.g. on Title)</del>
```

### Looping

  - ~~Complete the [looping](looping) feature, merge to trunk.~~
  - Update controller mappings...

### M4A

  - Solve packaging issues 
  - Solve Windows X64 libfaad2 dll [building
    issues](build_windows_dependencies#libfaad2) (embedded asm vs
    intrinsics)
  - ~~Fix SoundSourceM4A decoder issues~~ 

### PortMIDI Branch

*Remaining tasks here are just polish and are not required for release.*

  - ~~Move all PortMIDI calls to one thread (the script engines can not
    directly call send\*Msg anymore.) [See
    this.](http://lists.create.ucsb.edu/pipermail/media_api/2005-September/000422.html)~~
  - ~~Save multiple device files correctly, deleting previous .midi.xml
    files in .mixxx/~~ 

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Save the meta-data (<del>controller ID</del>, author, description, etc...)
      * First make a GUI object that lets the user modify the author and description
    * <del>Find a more appropriate place to save the files other than the MidiDeviceManager destructor</del> Now done (only) when OK is clicked in the prefs
    * <del>Need a way to keep track of duplicate devices so separate files can be saved: Have DlgPreferences::slotApply() call MidiDeviceManager::saveMappings() which does them all in one shot (and can thereby keep track of them)</del>
* <del>Load those files correctly</del>
    * <del>Load files for attached devices regardless of if they're activated or not.</del>
* Replace MidiCategory with MidiStatusByte permanently (see mididevice.cpp line 195.)
* MIDI Scripting: <del>Pass the <group> value from the XML to the script as an additional parameter (at the end of the list so existing scripts are not affected.)</del> - Done by Phil
* GUI changes:
    * <del>Replace "Activate" button with an "Enabled" check box</del>
    * <del>Display enabled devices in the tree in bold text</del>
    * <del>Auto-change "Output" drop-down based on auto-selected output device in MidiDevice(Manager) when the device is enabled</del> - Albert
    * <del>Make "Output" drop-down take effect when changed</del> - not happening in 1.8. Output drop-down is disabled for now.
    * Persistent mapping preset drop-down (don't return to "..." unless Clear All is pressed. If the user tweaks the mapping, say "<custom>" or something.)
    * Also clear the list of MIDI scripts when Clear All is pressed
    * Do not commit changes to the MIDI mapping tables unless OK is pressed in the preferences window. (I.e. allow pressing the Cancel button or the X on the preferences window to restore the MIDI mappings to their previous states.)
```

# Deferred to 1.9

### Vinyl control

  - Integrate the latest xwax release code

### MIDI scripting

  - Add MIDI script timers (using QTimer)
  - Add a way to pass extra parameters from the MIDI mapping to the
    script function ?

### Engine

  - Sample accurate scratching: Script use cases:
    1.  Tell the Engine to move to absolute sample \#X (and/or X'
        elapsed seconds) in Y time, and the Engine will play all the
        samples between the current and target in the specified time
        (and fire a signal when it's there) without affecting play
        status, optionally holding at the target sample until given
        further instruction
    2.  Tell the Engine to move X samples (or X' seconds)
        forward/backward in Y time
    3.  Implement alpha-beta smoothing filter in the Engine (currently
        in scratch.\* functions in the common script file) with
        fixed-interval updates. (I.e. if no new data arrives in the
        interval, assume the control is stopped and feed that data to
        the smoothing function.)
