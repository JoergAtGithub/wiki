# Things to do for v1.8.0

  - Library: Complete the rewrite for basic -- but stable --
    functionality
  - Looping: Complete the [looping](looping) feature
  - Vinyl control: Integrate the latest xwax release code
  - MIDI scripting:
  - Add MIDI script timers (using QTimer)
  - Pass the \<group\> value from the XML to the script as an additional
    parameter (at the end of the list so existing scripts are not
    affected.)
  - PortMIDI Branch:
  - Save multiple device files correctly, deleting previous .midi.xml
    files in .mixxx/
  - Load those files correctly
