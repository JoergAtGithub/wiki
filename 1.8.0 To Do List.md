# Things to do for v1.8.0

  - Library: Complete the rewrite for basic -- but stable --
    functionality
  - Track DB
  - ~~Searching across library features~~
  - ~~Browse Mode~~

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Needs header that shows you your current path
    * Sorting doesn't work in Size column (kb/mb treated as the same)
* Playlists 
* Play Queue 
* Working Library Rescan
* Tagging
* Track Sources
* Minor Bugs
    * <del>Duration Delegate should format seconds as %02d.</del> 
    * <del>Sorting is not case insensitive (e.g. on Title)</del>
    * <del>Sorting doesn't work in XML-sourced Playlists</del> 
    * <del>Playlists need duration delegate</del>
    * iTunes needs duration delegate
    * Rhythmbox Need Date delegate
    * <del>Rhythmbox sorting doesn't work</del>
    * <del>Search is saved and restored per-model</del>
    * <del>Make Search work on all views/models</del>
    * <del>Make sure Search is case-insensitive everywhere.</del>
    * Playlist table headers show raw column names
* Looping: <del>Complete the [[looping]] feature, merge to trunk.</del>.
* Vinyl control: Integrate the latest xwax release code
* MIDI scripting:
* Add MIDI script timers (using QTimer)
* Pass the <group> value from the XML to the script as an additional parameter (at the end of the list so existing scripts are not affected.)
* Add a way to pass extra parameters from the MIDI mapping to the script function ?
* PortMIDI Branch:
* <del>Move all PortMIDI calls to one thread (the script engines can not directly call send*Msg anymore.) [[http://lists.create.ucsb.edu/pipermail/media_api/2005-September/000422.html|See this.]]</del>
* <del>Save multiple device files correctly, deleting previous .midi.xml files in .mixxx/</del> 
    * Save the meta-data (<del>controller ID</del>, author, description, etc...)
      * First make a GUI object that lets the user modify the author and description
    * <del>Find a more appropriate place to save the files other than the MidiDeviceManager destructor</del> Now done (only) when OK is clicked in the prefs
    * <del>Need a way to keep track of duplicate devices so separate files can be saved: Have DlgPreferences::slotApply() call MidiDeviceManager::saveMappings() which does them all in one shot (and can thereby keep track of them)</del>
* <del>Load those files correctly</del>
    * <del>Load files for attached devices regardless of if they're activated or not.</del>
* Replace MidiCategory with MidiStatusByte permanently (see mididevice.cpp line 195.)
* GUI changes:
    * Replace "Activate" button with an "Enabled" check box
    * Display enabled devices in the tree in bold text
    * Auto-change "Output" drop-down based on auto-selected output device in MidiDevice(Manager) when the device is enabled
    * Make "Output" drop-down take effect when changed
    * Persistent mapping preset drop-down (don't return to "..." unless Clear All is pressed. If the user tweaks the mapping, say "<custom>" or something.)
    * Also clear the list of MIDI scripts when Clear All is pressed
    * Do not commit changes to the MIDI mapping tables unless OK is pressed in the preferences window. (I.e. allow pressing the Cancel button or the X on the preferences window to restore the MIDI mappings to their previous states.)
* M4A
* Solve packaging issues 
* Solve Windows X64 libfaad2 dll [[build_windows_dependencies#libfaad2|building issues]] (embedded asm vs intrinsics)
* <del>Fix SoundSourceM4A decoder issues</del>
