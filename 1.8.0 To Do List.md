# Things to do for v1.8.0

### Library

**Very important remaining tasks for beta2**:

  - Use autopointers for TIOs? - Reworking the way the AnalyserQueue
    works instead (in progress by Adam)
  - Update LibraryTableModel's rows when TrackDAO is accessed, without
    resetting it. (How?\!)
  - M4A Plugin + Downloader
  - Featured Artists agreement + stats

**Very important remaining tasks for beta1**:

  - ~~Missing columns in playlist/crate/autodj views
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/500474>~~
  - ~~Schema versioning~~
  - ~~1.7.0 to 1.8.0 XML-\>DB Library importer (Patch from Zach)~~
  - ~~Playlist blurb~~
  - ~~Crate image blurb~~
  - Fix as many crashes as possible

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * <del>SoundTouch timestretch</del>
    * <del>Reader ASSERT(s)</del> (haven't seen these in a while, might have been the same bug as below - Albert)
    * <del>MIDI script engine crash</del> (https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/493793)
* <del>Crate/Playlist/MissingTracks need working location column.</del>

    * <del>Needs blacklisting of removed songs.</del>
* <del>1.7.0 to 1.8.0 XML->DB Library importer (Zach)</del>

* Cue/Loop Storage in the DB - (this is really a mini-project in itself) 
    * <del>Write a CueDAO/Cue service.</del>
    * <del>Make TIO's have a list of Cue's</del>
    * <del>Make TrackCollection save a TIO's Cue's on track save (via CueDAO)</del>

    * <del>Restore track-editor, make it show hotcues</del>
    * Add custom widgets for hotcues -- not happening: skins will have to have hacked buttons instead
    * <del>Waveform / waveform overview loops and cues</del>
    * <del>Update skins</del>

```

### Looping

  - ~~Complete the [looping](looping) feature, merge to trunk.~~
  - Update controller mappings...

### M4A

  - Solve packaging issues 
  - Solve Windows X64 libfaad2 dll [building
    issues](build_windows_dependencies#libfaad2) (embedded asm vs
    intrinsics)
  - ~~Fix SoundSourceM4A decoder issues~~ 

### MIDI Sub-system tasks

*Remaining tasks here are just polish and are not required for release.*

  - ~~Move all PortMIDI calls to one thread (the script engines can not
    directly call send\*Msg anymore.) [See
    this.](http://lists.create.ucsb.edu/pipermail/media_api/2005-September/000422.html)~~
  - ~~Save multiple device files correctly, deleting previous .midi.xml
    files in .mixxx/~~ 

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Save the meta-data (<del>controller ID</del>, author, description, etc...)
      * First make a GUI object that lets the user modify the author and description
    * <del>Find a more appropriate place to save the files other than the MidiDeviceManager destructor</del> Now done (only) when OK is clicked in the prefs
    * <del>Need a way to keep track of duplicate devices so separate files can be saved: Have DlgPreferences::slotApply() call MidiDeviceManager::saveMappings() which does them all in one shot (and can thereby keep track of them)</del>
* <del>Load those files correctly</del>
    * <del>Load files for attached devices regardless of if they're activated or not.</del>
* Replace MidiCategory with MidiStatusByte permanently (see mididevice.cpp line 195.)
* MIDI Scripting: <del>Pass the <group> value from the XML to the script as an additional parameter (at the end of the list so existing scripts are not affected.)</del> - Done by Phil
* GUI changes:
    * <del>Replace "Activate" button with an "Enabled" check box</del>
    * <del>Display enabled devices in the tree in bold text</del>
    * <del>Auto-change "Output" drop-down based on auto-selected output device in MidiDevice(Manager) when the device is enabled</del> - Albert
    * <del>Make "Output" drop-down take effect when changed</del> - not happening in 1.8. Output drop-down is disabled for now.
    * Persistent mapping preset drop-down (don't return to "..." unless Clear All is pressed. If the user tweaks the mapping, say "<custom>" or something.)
    * Also clear the list of MIDI scripts when Clear All is pressed
    * Do not commit changes to the MIDI mapping tables unless OK is pressed in the preferences window. (I.e. allow pressing the Cancel button or the X on the preferences window to restore the MIDI mappings to their previous states.)
```

# Deferred to 1.9

### Vinyl control

  - Integrate the latest xwax release code - This is deferred because
    there are easy-to-mess-up hacks in the xwax code to get it to build
    on Windows and it would require much more testing than we have time
    for 1.8.

### MIDI scripting

  - ~~Add MIDI script timers~~ - done in features\_scriptTimers
  - Add a way to pass extra parameters from the MIDI mapping to the
    script function ?
  - MIDI script cross-communication (via custom Control\[Objects\] the
    scripts can create via special ScriptEngine functions)

### Engine

  - Sample accurate scratching: Script use cases:
    1.  Tell the Engine to move to absolute sample \#X (and/or Y elapsed
        seconds) over Z seconds of real time, and the Engine will play
        all the samples between the current and target in the specified
        time (and fire a signal when it's there) without affecting play
        status, optionally holding at the target sample until given
        further instruction
    2.  Tell the Engine to move X samples (or Y seconds)
        forward/backward over Z seconds of real time
    3.  Implement alpha-beta smoothing filter in the Engine (currently
        in scratch.\* functions in the common script file) with
        fixed-interval updates. (I.e. if no new data arrives in the
        interval, assume the control is stopped and feed that data to
        the smoothing function.)
