# Things to do for v1.9.0

### Shoutcast

  - Make a user interface that lets you connect to/disconnect from the
    server. Show some UI feedback if the connection drops.
  - Figure out how to stop Mixxx from crashing (libshout's fault) when
    the server crashes.

### Vinyl control

  - Integrate the latest xwax release code - This is deferred because
    there are easy-to-mess-up hacks in the xwax code to get it to build
    on Windows and it would require much more testing than we have time
    for 1.8.

### MIDI scripting

  - Add a way to pass extra parameters from the MIDI mapping to the
    script function ?
  - MIDI script cross-communication (via custom Control\[Objects\] the
    scripts can create via special ScriptEngine functions)

### Engine

  - Position-based scratching (as opposed to the current
    velocity-based.) Script use cases:
    1.  Tell the Engine to move the track X seconds forward/backward
        over Y seconds of real time. The engine will, without affecting
        play status, play all the samples between the current and target
        positions in the specified time (stretching as needed) and fire
        a signal when it's there, optionally holding at the target
        position until given further instruction. It must also queue
        requests so it ends up at the correct position.
    2.  Tell the Engine to move to absolute time X (in elapsed or
        remaining seconds) over Y seconds of real time
