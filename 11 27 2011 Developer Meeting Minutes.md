# Review of 1.10 Development Cycle

1.10 = big success\!

  - Loads of features
  - Release cycle took about twice as long as we hoped
  - May 1st planned release, about 7 months later is actual release...
  - Opt for fewer huge features for faster releases (deja vu?)
  - Press response is really good\!
  - Competitors are reacting fast, DJay price drop, etc.
  - Build server is fully operational now, does all the release work for
    us, allows for more testing, etc\!

## Features for 1.11

Effects 1.0

  - a couple more effects
  - lays groundwork for something big with Effects 2.0

N-Deck 1.0

  - not actually that useful, but important selling point and people
    still care about it.
  - 4 decks enabled in trunk, but not in skins yet.
  - Most remaining work is polish and fixing remaining areas that are
    hardcoded to 2 decks.

AutoDJ 2.0

  - Daniel Schurman
  - improved auto dj

Waveform 2.0

  - coloured waveforms, based on features of audio (low/mid/high) 
  - Thomas Vincent

Sync 2.0

  - nickname for usage of beat offsets and probably master tempo feature
  - integration of Queen Mary plugins from VAMP to get better beatgrids
    and much improved sync.

Controller 2.0

  - Sean Pappalardo rewriting MIDI system to add support for HID devices
    and potentially OSC
  - top DJ hardware brands are moving away from USB MIDI and towards HID

Library History

  - Continuing with our library improvements 

Advanced Search

  - GSoC project from 2011, hopefully finish up and get into release

Internationalization

  - translations so far are going well
  - working on automating process
  - still much more work to be done:
  - eg. tooltips in skins must be translatable
  - eg. keyboard layouts

Timeline

  - 3 month dev cycles were unrealistic, the release process itself
    still takes a lot of time
  - build server helped a lot, but let's continue reducing release
    process
  - let's try 4-6 months

<!-- end list -->

  - if 1.11 is 4 months, 
  - is 1 week enough to translate the manual into 5 languages?
  - do you have any numbers on how long existing translations took?

## Q\&A

Shashank Kumar - Wants to work on 7 band equalizer

jus

  - Will work on making the manual awesome\!
  - Would be nice if Native English speaker could review additions to
    manual

Phil will work on:

  - crazy effects plugins

Sean may need help with Controller 2.0 stuff

Feature priorities

  - prioritize based on improving perception, first impressions of
    Mixxx. Eg. 4-decks
  - Our flanger is tired. Effects will be the \#1 priority probably.
  - VAMP QM plugins will make a huge difference to user experience. 
  - Waveform is another big contributor to wow-factor. Need to make it
    look awesome.
