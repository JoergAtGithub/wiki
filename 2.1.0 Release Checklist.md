        as a backup and record independent of downloads.mixxx.org (for
        forensic purposes).

        1.  **TODO: Should we still do this? Haven't had download
            availability issues since enabling CloudFlare.**
            1.  \[pegasus\] I say yes. It doesn't hurt or cost anything

            jobs.
        2.  **NOTE:** Launchpad builds its own .debs, so this does not
            depend on building packages above. The "Update files:" step
            above should be complete though (Debian changelog,
