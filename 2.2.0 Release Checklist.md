    1.  This can be done to a commit after it has been pushed or merged

        remote.** 
9.  Upload packages.

    2.  Record SHA256sum of all packages in the [Release Checksums
        Google
        Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E5vFa0gKf47P3LMMXpnr3JzsZ7-ENI03IgOkj9lxYQo/edit#gid=0)
        as a backup and record independent of downloads.mixxx.org (for

            jobs.
        2.  **NOTE:** Launchpad builds its own .debs, so this does not
            depend on building packages above. The "Update files:" step
            above should be complete though (Debian changelog,

        cluttered desktop in the background.
        1.  macOS can produce particularly pretty drop-shadow
            screenshots with `Shift-Command-4` followed by the spacebar,
            then click the window to screenshot.
