On 5/17/2009 we had a developer meeting. Here are the minutes.

# Status

  - 1.7 is almost out the door - yay\!

# New Workflow

  - We all seem to be in agreement that only finished 100% features can
    go into trunk.
  - Unit testing\!
  - When we're ready to do a feature freeze, we cut the release branch
    for that release, and trunk goes onward.
  - Code reviews?\!?\!

# New Library

# LADSPA

# MIDI 3.0
