1\) Realise that males do not change - therefore don't have sex or get
married to some guy believing he is going to change. Before you make
your choice if he is Mr Right - be sure the many non-negotiables are
satisfied to begin with. Girls must feel completely delighted by who
their man is, or they will never be happy.

to improve interaction. Listen to one another and let each other
communicate without interruption. When listening to one another,
practice eye-to-eye contact so that each partner appreciates they are
being listened to.

count, so a woman must always feel and look her best. A woman should
ensure that her hair is styled and she is wearing beautiful attire.
Make-up shouldn't be overdone, but refined enough to make a difference.

can to thrill the man within her heart and soul. Dressing to thrill will
make a woman feel remarkable and she will ooze inner self-belief. When a
woman feels truly self-confident, she will attract men effortlessly
never having to try too hard.

looks, depth and individuality. Therefore, a woman ought to remember
that the earliest attraction of a man, develops from a woman's persona.

man first lays eyes on a woman, he would be attracted to her apparel,
physical attributes and self-belief. Women come in a variety of sizes
and shapes, guys are attracted to different types of women. A lady must
take proper care of herself. It's not eye-catching for men to view a
woman whom does not care about herself. The vast majority of men feel
that a lady has abandoned herself, if she isn't going to make the
effort. However, women shouldn't be preoccupied with the way they
appear. A proper balance is essential to a man's heart.

of their whole lives just to be with a man. Things may well not succeed
and therefore the woman is likely to have damaged or lost her identity.

everything to be with a man. A woman should keep her identity, have her
own friends and hobbies. If a man cannot deal with the woman's
associates, then he is obviously not Mr Right.
