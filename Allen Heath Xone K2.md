The Allen & Heath Xone:K2 is set up like a 4 channel mixer plus a grid
of buttons. It also has an integrated 4 channel sound card with 2 RCA
jacks and an 1/8" stereo headphone jack.

# Default Mixxx mapping

For the default mapping to work correctly, the device must be set to
operate on MIDI channel 16 and "latching layers" must be set to "Switch
Matrix" (2nd state). For information on how to do that read the user
guide of the device (linked above).

The behavior of the grid buttons depends on which layer is active, which
is changed by pressing the Layer button. The color of the text
background indicates what the button does in that layer, e.g. the
buttons of the last row activate hotcue 4 when the green layout is
selected, but act as the play button when the red layer is selected.

Text in blue describes secondary functions accessible when the shift
button is held down.
