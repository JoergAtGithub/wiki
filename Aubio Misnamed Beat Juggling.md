## Summary

**Status**: There is a branch which has most of these features
implemented. Testing is still needed.

Mixxx has BPM detection but not beat detection. Beat detection would
allow us to do man cool tricks including:

  - Jump from beat to beat
  - Quantize Effects
  - Create Beat Quantized loops
  - Do full Automatic Beat Syncing
