# Beginner DJ Links

Before delving into Mixxx, ask yourself what you want to do with music.
DJing is the art of mixing together music that has already been
recorded; making original music is producing. If you want to DJ, you are
in the right place. If you want make your own original music from start
to finish, Mixxx is not the right tool for the job. Music production is
done with a type program called a digital audio workstation (DAW), such
as [Ardour](http://ardour.org/) or [LMMS](http://lmms.io/), rather than
a DJ program.
