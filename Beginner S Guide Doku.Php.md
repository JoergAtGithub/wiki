For many reasons, building muscle is vital to the health of your body.
It will improve not only your strength, but also your appearance and
overall health, as well. As an added bonus, it is also great fun\!
Continue reading and you will find some fantastic advice about how to
build muscle and the many benefits it can provide you with.\<br /\>\<br
/\>Make room in your regimen for plyometric exercises. This type of
exercise strengthens the fast-twitch muscle fibers responsible for
stimulating muscle growth. Similar to ballistic moves, plyometric
exercises require you to accelerate your movements. As an example,
plyometric push-ups require that you end each rep by pushing hands up
and away from the floor as high as possible.\<br /\>\<br /\>Try out
creatine supplements. Creatine supplements have been shown to increase
pre-existing problems with the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Be
careful and informed when you are going to take supplements. Take the
creatine exactly as instructed on the label, never exceeding the
recommended amount.\<br /\>\<br /\>It is a common error to drastically
raise protein intake immediately upon starting muscle building programs.
That can result in excessive caloric intake which, if not countered by
increased exercise, may result in fat gain. Increase your protein intake
slowly, adding a couple hundred calories at a time every few days. Your
body will be able to keep up with the increase this way, using the extra
protein to grow muscle.\<br /\>\<br /\>Make sure you eat foods that are
high in protein before doing your workout. Before each workout, try to
consume a minimum of 20 grams of whey protein. This helps your muscles
recover more quickly and minimizes the chance that your body will use
muscle protein as energy while you work out.\<br /\>\<br /\>Always be
aware of your nutrition and what you are eating when trying to build
muscle. Muscles are made up of about 70 percent water, so consuming
enough water is crucial. Stay away from excessive amounts of alcohol, as
it can break down the muscle tissue.\<br /\>\<br /\>Eating well is
crucial when you are trying to build muscle. The body requires certain
nutrients if it is going to properly rebuild muscle fibers. Research has
shown that one of the reasons protein drinks work well when consumed
after a workout is that they help rebuild muscle fibers.\<br /\>\<br
/\>You should always eat breakfast, and this goes double when you are
trying to gain muscle mass. You can start your day off right by eating a
breakfast rich in quality carbs, fats and proteins. Breakfast gets your
metabolism flowing and will help your muscles rebuild.\<br /\>\<br /\>If
you start to feel pain, it is important that you immediately stop your
workout. It is easy to injure your muscles and tendons, so don't push
yourself too hard just to build muscle. If you feel any pain or are
sore, take some time off, allowing your body to regain its strength.\<br
/\>\<br /\>Eating proteins will help you build your muscles. Muscle
requires protein to rebuild after a workout, and a protein deficiency
will actually reduce your muscle mass. Try to consume up to a gram of
protein daily for each pound you weigh.\<br /\>\<br /\>Make sure you
stretch before every workout. Your muscles should be warmed up prior to
exercise, in order to avoid injury. Stretching after exercise can help,
too, by relaxing your muscles while the start to recover from the
workout. Massages help to relax and also encourage muscles to grow more
quickly.\<br /\>\<br /\>Setting short-term goals and rewarding yourself
for attaining these goals can be an excellent source of motivation.
While long-term goals for muscle gain are important, it is sometimes
hard to maintain motivation without shorter, and more quickly measured
goals. Try setting up rewards that can assist you in your quest of
gaining muscle. As an example, get a massage; your blood flow can be
improved.\<br /\>\<br /\>Steroids can be dangerous, so avoid them. They
can inhibit your body's production of essential hormones, causing
serious damage. Besides that, steroids can cause liver damage, reduce
your level of "good" cholesterol, and stimulate breast growth in men.
"Roid rage," the pattern of violent mood swings and reduced impulse
control commonly associated with steroid use, is very real. Steroids can
even result in severe acne outbreaks. In other words, the disadvantages
of steroid use far outweigh the benefits.\<br /\>\<br /\>Setting
short-term goals and rewarding yourself for attaining these goals can be
an excellent source of motivation. Due to the fact that gaining muscle
is a commitment that is long-term and requires a significant amount of
time, maintaining motivation is vitally important. You can even set
rewards that are beneficial for your muscle gaining efforts. If you were
to treat yourself to an occasional massage, it would help your recovery
by increasing blood flow to your muscles, helping you relax, and
alleviating soreness, allowing you to return to your workouts
well-rested.\<br /\>\<br /\>It can be beneficial to train opposite
muscles during the same workout. Examples are the muscles in your back
and the muscles in your stomach, or the quads and the hamstrings. This
way, one muscle can get a rest while you are working out the other. You
can increase the intensity of your workout to make up for spending less
time in the gym.\<br /\>\<br /\>Remember to do your stretches before you
begin exercising. Stretching makes all the difference to a workout, as
it can help to prevent injuries and reduce pain after the workout.
Another way to encourage muscle recovery is through gentle massage,
which often incorporates gentle stretches.\<br /\>\<br /\>Try taking
photos naked every few days. When looking at your appearance in a mirror
daily, it may be difficult to view progress. Pictures will help you see
how much you have accomplished throughout your program.\<br /\>\<br
/\>Try putting your exercises in a different order. Don't get stuck in a
rut. If you do not mix up your exercises, the exercise you do last will
always be performed when you are tired. That muscle group will lag
behind. If you occasionally start your routine with those muscles, you
can produce more growth by giving them a good workout.\<br /\>\<br
/\>Quite often, people will mistakenly emphasize their speed instead of
technique. It doesn't matter which exercise you perform, slowing down
your reps to ensure that your technique is perfect will help you to get
better results in a shorter amount of time. Take all the time you need
and make sure you perform the exercises like you should.\<br /\>\<br

when you are trying to build muscle. Remember these tips so you can
build muscle tone efficiently. If you are tired of not seeing results
