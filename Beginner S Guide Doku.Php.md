Raspberry leaf tea is tea which is extracted from the leaves of
raspberry. Raspberry, a delicious fruit native to North America and
Europe is one of the most versatile and nutritious fruits available in
nature. It has been used in herbal medicines for several hundred years
due to the health benefits it provides.\<br /\>\<br /\>For numerous
decades, midwives have accepted the importance of herbal treatments when
applied during pregnancy. One of the most widely used is \<a

leaf tea\</a\> and is consumed both during gestation and delivery.
Raspberry leaf tea has been widely employed throughout South and North
America, Europe and China by pregnant women.\<br /\>\<br /\>Raspberry
leaf tea is stacked with nutrients and contains vitamins A, C, E and B,
magnesium, calcium and iron. These nutrients are helpful for a healthy
pregnancy. Raspberry leaf tea also consists of the alkaloid 'fragine'
which is expected to strengthen and tone the muscles of the uterus,
helping them to contract more efficiently during labor. It is very very
important not to use raspberry leaves until the last two months of
pregnancy because of their stimulating effect on the uterus.\<br /\>\<br
/\>The importance of consuming raspberry leaf tea ahead of and during
the whole of pregnancy comprise:\<br /\>\<br /\>1. Increasing fertility
(especially when combined with Red Clover)\<br /\>2. Preventing
miscarriage\<br /\>3. Easing morning sickness\<br /\>4. Reducing pain
during labor and after birth\<br /\>5. Assisting in the production of
plentiful breast milk\<br /\>\<br /\>A simple breakdown of the Red
Raspberry Leaf tea's "ingredients" are as follows:\<br /\>\<br /\>1.
Vitamin E, for better blood circulation, since during pregnancy we have
much more running through our bodies.\<br /\>2. Vitamin A, for healthy
baby skin and bone development.\<br /\>3. Vitamin B complex\<br /\>4.
High concentration of vitamin C\<br /\>5. Calcium, an easily assimilated
form that helps control nerve response to pain during childbirth and
aids baby's bone development.\<br /\>6. Iron\<br /\>7. Manganese\<br
/\>8. Magnesium\<br /\>9. Minerals including phosphorous and
potassium\<br /\>\<br /\>Research has found that taking raspberry leaf

during the weeks prior to delivery helps to shorten the second stage of
labor by making contractions more effective. There is no evidence to
show that red raspberry leaf will encourage labor to begin.\<br /\>\<br
/\>Most of these \<a
href='<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1702706/pdf/brjpharm00555-0179.pdf>'\>studies\</a\>
have corroborated the ancient belief in the medicinal benefits of
raspberry tea particularly in pregnancy cases related to inducing labor
and reducing the discomfort felt by pregnant women due to
contractions.\<br /\>\<br /\>Many physicians recommended starting to
take the tea at 32 weeks and then through to the birth. There have been
no officially reported side effects but many women report that they
suffer from nausea, increased Braxton-Hicks contractions, and diarrhea
after consuming raspberry tea. Consuming the tea earlier in the first
trimester may also help prevent miscarriage. One common misconception is
that using raspberry leaf tea can help induce labor.\<br /\>\<br /\>For
the best possible results drink one cup per day prior to conception and
during the first trimester, during your second trimester increase your
daily intake to two cups per day. When you reach your third trimester
you should begin drinking four cups of the raspberry leaf tea daily. Do
this and you will have the best experience ever.\<br /\>\<br /\>More
