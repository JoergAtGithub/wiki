Thoughts Incorporated is hosting a writing contest for December 2012.
The topic is "what December means to me". Writings of any genre or
format can be submitted by any member of site. The site is free to join
and all level writers are invited to part. Amazon Giftcards will be
rewarded to the winners chosen by an announced staff member.\<br /\>\<br
/\>The contest was suggested by the sites moderators with the idea to
share and experience the many different views of December. When
discussing the contest, one of the sites moderators said: "Most of us
consider it a holiday season. I wonder what other people see it as. I'm
sure there are perspectives that we never thought of".\<br /\>\<br
