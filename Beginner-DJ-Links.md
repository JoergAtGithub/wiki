# Beginner DJ Links

Before delving into Mixxx, ask yourself what you want to do with music.
DJing is the art of mixing together music that has already been
recorded; making original music is producing. 
* If you want to DJ, you are
in the right place!
* If you want make your own original music from start
to finish, Mixxx is not the right tool for the job. Music production is
done with a type program called a digital audio workstation (DAW), such
as [Ardour](http://ardour.org/) or [LMMS](http://lmms.io/), rather than
a DJ program.
