## Hardware

This device is composed by <span class="underline">endless
encoders</span> sending two states position, momentary push buttons and
a single stepper encoder for library browsing. Its LEDs cannot be turned
off or dimmed and are lighting in **orange** by default. They can be set
in two modes : **blue** or **blinking blue**.

### LEDs Brightness

There is two levels for the brightness of the LEDs equipped on the CMD
line products :

  - Dimmed
  - Bright (Max :?:)

Toggling between them can simply be done by pressing the four bottom
buttons of the controller at same time and this can be done anytime
while it is running (plugged to power via USB).

## Mapping Description

The following description mapping is for a community mapping that you

### Library browsing & Load tracks

The big encoder is used to scroll through the library and pressing on it
will load the selected track to the available deck that is currently not
playing.

Loading selected track to a specified Deck is done by calling buttons
around this big encoder.

### Deck Selection

They are located in the corners above encoders :
