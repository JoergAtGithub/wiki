# Behringer CMD MM-1 Advanced Mapping

This is my Advanced mapping for the Behringer CMD MM-1. Its main focus
was not to make a complete mapping for the whole CMD series, but instead
to add the features that the mapping for the Novation Launchpad MK2 is
missing [Mixxx mapping for Novation Launchpad
ðŸ¦„](novation_launchpad_mapping_by_szdavid92). This mapping can of
course also by itself.

Thanks to Mevsme for the 3D-Model of the controller.

### The concept

Similar to the mentioned Launchpad Mapping, this mapping features two
modifiers: \[*SHIFT*\] and \[**CTRL**\] These allow each button to have
up to four functionalities. They behave like the normal shift and
control keys on your PC-Keyboard. Most of the features can be explained
via the renderings where the functionalities are marked via the
formatting of the Text (\[*SHIFT*\] and \[**CTRL**\]).

Its also possible to remap the entire order of the channel from
\[3,1,2,4\] to \[1,2,3,4\].

### Global variables

There are four global variables at the top of the script:

  - CHANNELNUMBER: The standard channelnumber of the CMD MM-1 is 5 but
    it can differ. If thats the case you can change it here
  - INVERTCOLOR: Swaps the colors which suits certain skins more
  - STANDARDCHANNELSEQUENCE: Defines if the channels laid out in
    \[1,2,3,4\] or \[3,1,2,4\] sequence by default.
  - STANDARDKNOBBEHAVIOR: Defines the default mapping of the knobs.

### The top row

The Out1 and Out2 buttons didn't have any obvious functionality so they
control the knobs of the EffectUnits. You can see that they control the
super-knobs of FxUnit1 & FxUnit2 in normal mode (no formating), The
mix-knobs of FxUnit1 & FxUnit2 in shift mode (*italic*), the super-knobs
of FxUnit3 & FxUnit4 in ctrl mode (**bold**) and the mix-knobs of
FxUnit3 & FxUnit4 in thirdMode (***bold\&italic***).

You can see the L/R buttons besides the encoder as shift- and
ctrlbuttons.

The Encoder in the middle is able to browse the library and jump on the
previewdeck (16 steps) while holding shift. When pressing the encoder,
the selected/highlighted track in the library gets loaded into the
previewdeck. The Previewdeck can be played/paused when holding shift
while pressing the encoder down.

The Cue Vol/Mix knobs have no alternative functionality.

### Knob unit

The Knobs have three different mappings which can be cycled while in
operation. (more on that later) The first one is the standard
\[High,Mid,Low,Quickeffect\]-Combo. The second one shifts everything up
and is mapped to \[Gain,High,Mid,Low\] which some DJs might prefer. The
third one controls the EffectUnits \[Meta1,Meta2,Meta3,Mix\]. The
Effectunit is based on the channel/deck number, so the channel that
controls the knobs/buttons/faders of channel 1 also controls the knobs
of EffectUnit1, Channel 2 controls EffectUnit2, etc.

### MiddleButton/exShift ;-)

Normal: toggle maximize library, Shift: recenter Crossfader Ctrl: Cycle
Knob assignment (swaps the mapping of the knobs as mentioned earlier.
Third: Reassing Channel Sequence (Swaps between \[3,1,2,4\] to
\[1,2,3,4\])

### Buttons

[[/media/hardware/behringer/behringercmdmm1-buttonslabeled.png|]]

\[1\]&\[2\] Buttons:

  - Normal: Toggle Fx1&2 for desired Channel
  - Shift: Change Crossfaderside (Orientation)
  - Ctrl: Toggle Fx3&4 for desired Channel

\[CUE\] Buttons:

  - Pre-Fader-Listening
  - Load selected Track to Deck
  - Enable Fx-PFL for Unit according to channel number.
  - reset BPM-Fader FIXME

### Faders

  - Normal: Volume Fader
  - Shift: Rate-/BPM-Faders

### Troubleshooting

MY CONTROLLER DOESNT LIGHT UP, HELP\!\!\!11 The issue is probably the
Midi-Channel of your MM-1. Behringer has a tool that allows every
controller in the CMD-series to change its midi-channel. So your
controller is probably set to the wrong channel. The easiest way to fix
this is to use Behringers tool and set it do MIDI-CHANNEL 5 (THIS IS
IMPORTANT).
<https://musicgroup-prod.mindtouch.us/04_BEHRINGER/CMD-_How_Do_I_Change_MIDI_Channel_On_My_CMD_Controller%3F>
If you cant do that for some reason, you have to find out the channel
your MM-1 is sending on at the time. Once you know that you should go
change the line where it says "var CHANNELNUMBER = 5;" of the file
"Behringer-CMD-MM-1-Advanced-scripts.js" in the folder with the mappings
so there is the number of your channel instead of the 5. (IMPORTANT: NO
PARENTHESES). The you have to find the file "Behringer
CMD-MM-1-Advanced.midi.xml" in the same folder and replace the 4 at the
end of 0x94, 0x84 and 0xB4 with your CHANNEL-NUMBER MINUS 1. Restart mix
and then it should work.
