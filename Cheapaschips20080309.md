**About Kid 90**

> I host an independent New Zealand electronica (Kiwi-tronica) show on
> one of NZ's student radio stations [RDU](http://www.rdu.org.nz). The
> show runs from 5-7pm Saturdays (NZ time) and I occasionally use MIXXX
> for the show, too (it would be more often but I don't like leaving my
> wife at home without our laptop\!). I've been DJing for more than half
> my life and have recently turned to the dark-side....DIGITAL\! I tend
> to play Downbeat, Breaks & D'n'B with a little Psy thrown in for good
> measure.
