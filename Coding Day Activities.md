# Coding Day

On Tuesday July 29th, we'll be having a day of code to get release 1.6.0
ready to go. Obviously there's tons of stuff to do, here's a list:

  - Coding/Bug fixing obviously needs doing, visit the [launchpad
    tracker](https://launchpad.net/mixxx/) and talk to the developers
  - Testing will be needed at various points on various platforms
    throughout the day
  - Documentation needs plenty of work
  - Especially the [manual](manual) could use a lot of work
  - New website design is in progress, anyone with useful php/javascript
    skills should talk to asantoni
  - Could use some new high quality skins if there are any designers out
    there
