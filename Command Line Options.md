====== Command line options ======

Mixxx is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. As such, its command line options are only useful for development or debugging, as they make these tasks easier. Here is an exhaustive list:

//These are case-sensitive//

===== 2.1-alpha =====

You can load supported sound files directly into the virtual decks by specifying them at the command line.

^Option^Description^Code location^
|//filename//|Loads the specified music file at start-up (of the types Mixxx supports.) Each file you specify will be loaded into the next deck.| |
|''-''''-resourcePath //path//'' |Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for its resource files such as controller presets, overriding the default installation location|configobject.cpp, line |
|''-''''-pluginPath //path//'' |Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for for sound source plugins in addition to default locations |soundsourceproxy.cpp, line |
|''-''''-settingsPath //path//'' |Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for settings.| |
|''-''''-controllerDebug''|Causes Mixxx to display/log all of the MIDI/HID/etc. messages it receives and script functions it loads| |
|''-''''-developer''|Enables developer-mode. Includes extra log info, stats on performance, and a Developer tools menu.| |
|''-''''-safeMode''|Enables safe-mode. Disables OpenGL waveforms, and spinning vinyl widgets. Try this option if Mixxx is crashing on startup.| |
|''-''''-locale LOCALE ''|Use a custom locale for loading translations (e.g 'fr')|main.cpp, line |
|''-f'', ''-''''-fullScreen''|Causes Mixxx to start in full-screen mode|main.cpp, line |
|''-''''-logLevel LEVEL''|Sets the verbosity of command line logging
  critical - Critical/Fatal only
  warning  - Above + Warnings
  info     - Above + Informational messages
  debug    - Above + Debug/Developer messages
  trace    - Above + Profiling messages
