## Qt Creator Build Off of Trunk

The following is alternate way to build Mixxx from trunk using the Qt
Creator IDE.

### Steps

1.  Get the Qt Creator Bundle:
    qtcreator-0.9.2-rc1-windows-bundle-setup.exe
2.  Get an SVN Client (TortoseSVN)
3.  Install both
4.  SVN check out mixxx
5.  Open mixxx.pro inside Qt Creator
6.  Hit the green run (\>) button

### Current Issues/Fixes TODO:

  - You need to change "script/ui\_scriptstudio.h" to
    "ui\_scriptstudio.h" on scriptstudio.h line \#5.
  - .mixxx\_version.svn and .mixxx\_flags.svn are currently not
    generated by the Qt Creator build process, references in mixxx.cpp
    need to be removed. (or may just just create empty dumpy files using
    cmd.exe echo\>.file) 
  - After building mixxx will fail to run with a big negative error code
    meaning its missing dlls in mixxx\\bin\\, run mixxx\\bin\\mixxx.exe
    outside of Qt Creator to get a dialog explaining what dll file to
    copy into the mixxx\\bin dir.

### Tip: Reduce Disk Space Used by Qt

To cut down on the 2GB that Qt Creator install takes, You may want to
delete or zip-n-delete:

  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\examples (\~600MB)
  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtWebKitd4.dll (\~230MB, Mixxx doesn't
    use WebKit yet -\> zip to 30MB)
  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\lib\\QtWebKitd4.dll (\~230MB 2nd copy)
