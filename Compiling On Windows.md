## Qt Creator Build Off of Trunk

The following is alternate way to build Mixxx from trunk using the [Qt
Creator IDE](http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/qt-creator). It differs
from the normal way of building in that it uses qmake and minGW/GCC, but
does not depend on Python, SCons, or Microsoft Visual Studio.

### Steps

1.  Get the Qt Creator Bundle:
    [qtcreator-0.9.2-rc1-windows-bundle-setup.exe](http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/qt-creator/qt-creator#qt-creator-binary-packages)
    \~390MB
2.  Get an SVN Client (i.e.
    [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads))
3.  Install both
4.  SVN check out *mixxx* and *mixxx-winlib* from trunk - repo is
    <https://mixxx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mixxx/trunk/>
5.  Open *mixxx.pro* inside Qt Creator which lives in the *mixxx* svn
    checkout you made in the previous step.
6.  Hit the green run (\>) button

### Current Issues/Fixes TODO:

  - You need to change "*script/ui\_scriptstudio.h*" to
    "*ui\_scriptstudio.h*" on *scriptstudio.h* line \#5.
  - *.mixxx\_version.svn* and *.mixxx\_flags.svn* are currently not
    generated by the Qt Creator build process, references in mixxx.cpp
    need to be removed. (or may just just create empty dumpy files using
    cmd.exe echo\>.file) 
  - You might need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
    Redistributable Package from here (depending on which CPU
    architecture Mixxx was compiled for):
    [x86](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=65127),
    [x64](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=90548130-4468-4bbc-9673-d6acabd5d13b&displaylang=en),
    [ia64](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=45&p=1&srcdisplaylang=en&srccategoryid=&srcfamilyid=90548130-4468-4bbc-9673-d6acabd5d13b&u=details.aspx?familyid=526bf4a7-44e6-4a91-b328-a4594adb70e5&displaylang=en)
  - After building Mixxx will fail to run with a big negative error code
    meaning its missing dlls in *mixxx\\bin\\*, run
    *mixxx\\bin\\mixxx.exe* outside of *Qt Creator* to get a dialog
    explaining what dll file to copy into the *mixxx\\bin* dir.
    1.  QtCreator\\mingw\\bin\\mingwm10.dll
    2.  mixxx\\mixxx-winlib\\vorbis.dll
    3.  mixxx\\mixxx-winlib\\ogg.dll
    4.  mixxx\\mixxx-winlib\\vorbisfile.dll
    5.  mixxx\\mixxx-winlib\\portaudio.dll
    6.  mixxx\\mixxx-winlib\\sndfile.dll
    7.  QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\Qt3Supportd4.dll
    8.  QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtCored4.dll
    9.  QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtGuid4.dll
    10. QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtNetworkd4.dll
    11. QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtSqld4.dll
    12. QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtXmld4.dll
    13. QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtOpenGLd4.dll
    14. QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtScriptd4.dll
  - Need to copy directories to bin folder: skins

### Tip: Reduce Disk Space Used by Qt

To cut down on the 2GB that Qt Creator install takes, You may want to
delete or zip-n-delete:

  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\examples (\~600MB -\> zip to \~120MB)
  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\bin\\QtWebKitd4.dll (\~230MB, Mixxx doesn't
    use WebKit yet -\> zip to \~30MB)
  - C:\\Qt\\QtCreator\\qt\\lib\\QtWebKitd4.dll (\~230MB 2nd copy)
