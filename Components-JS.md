Components JS is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to code controller
mappings for Mixxx. It lets you focus more on your controller and less on the
details of MIDI signals and how Mixxx works. It is centered around JavaScript
objects called Components that represent a physical component of a controller,
such as a button, knob, fader, or encoder. Components provide generic functions
that can be made to work for most use cases just by changing some attributes of
the Component, without having to write many or any custom functions. The library
also provides more specialized Components for common use cases. Components can
be organized into ComponentContainer objects, making it easy to iterate over
them and change their behavior to switch between different modes.

Components JS is new in Mixxx 2.1 and does not work with older versions of
Mixxx. To use the library, in the `<scriptfiles>` element at the top of your
mapping's [XML file](MIDI-controller-mapping-file-format), load the Lodash
library and the Components library (above the link to your controller's script
file):

```xml
<file filename="lodash.mixxx.js"/>
<file filename="midi-components-0.0.js"/>
<file functionprefix="MyController" filename="My_Controller_SCRIPT.js"/>
```

Components JS uses a few functions from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), which is
why they both need to be loaded. Importing the midi-components-0.0.js file makes
the library accessible by an object called `components` (plural, lower case).

If you are not familiar with object oriented programming in JavaScript, read
Mozilla Developer Network's [Object-oriented JavaScript
introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS).
If you are familiar with OOP in other languages but new to JavaScript, you can
skip ahead to the [Constructors and object
instances](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS#Constructors_and_object_instances)
section of that tutorial.

## File structure

To map most controllers, create a custom subtype of [\#Deck](#deck) and create
instances of your custom Deck objects in your controller's `init` function. Use
the custom Deck's constructor function to create all the Components you need for
your particular controller. The example below is for a typical 2 deck
controller. If you are mapping a controller with a different layout, some
changes to this general structure may be necessary. There is a lot to explain
here, so don't worry about understanding every detail just yet:

```javascript
// Declare the variable for your controller and assign it to an empty object
var MyController = {};

// Mixxx calls this function on startup or when the controller
// is enabled in the Mixxx Preferences
MyController.init = function () {
    // create an instance of your custom Deck object for each side of your controller
    MyController.leftDeck = new MyController.Deck([1, 3], 1);
    MyController.rightDeck = new MyController.Deck([2, 4], 2);
};

MyController.shutdown = function () {
    // send whatever MIDI messages you need to turn off the lights of your controller
};

// implement a constructor for a custom Deck object specific to your controller
MyController.Deck = function (deckNumbers, midiChannel) {
    // Call the generic Deck constructor to setup the currentDeck and deckNumbers properties,
    // using Function.prototype.call to assign the custom Deck being constructed
    // to 'this' in the context of the generic components.Deck constructor
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
    components.Deck.call(this, deckNumbers);
    this.playButton = new components.PlayButton([0x90 + midiChannel, 0x01]);
    this.cueButton = new components.CueButton([0x90 + midiChannel, 0x02]);
    this.syncButton = new components.SyncButton([0x90 + midiChannel, 0x03]);
    this.pflButton = new components.Button({
        midi: [0x90 + channel, 0x04],
        key: 'pfl',
    });
    this.hotcueButtons = [];
    for (var i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
        this.hotcueButtons[i] = new components.HotcueButton({
            midi: [0x90 + midiChannel, 0x10 + i],
            number: i,
        });
    }

    this.volume = new components.Pot({
        midi: [0xB0 + midiChannel, 0x01],
        inKey: 'volume',
    });

    this.eqKnob = [];
    for (var k = 1; k <= 3; k++) {
        this.eqKnob[k] = new components.Pot({
            midi: [0xB0 + midiChannel, 0x02 + k],
            group: '[EqualizerRack1_' + this.currentDeck + '_Effect1]',
            inKey: 'parameter' + k,
        });
    }

    // ... define as many other Components as necessary ...

    // Set the group properties of the above Components and connect their output callback functions
    // Without this, the group property for each Component would have to be specified to its
    // constructor.
    this.reconnectComponents(function (c) {
        if (c.group === undefined) {
            // 'this' inside a function passed to reconnectComponents refers to the ComponentContainer
            // so 'this' refers to the custom Deck object being constructed
            c.group = this.currentDeck;
        }
    });
    // when called with JavaScript's 'new' keyword, a constructor function
    // implicitly returns 'this'
};
// give your custom Deck all the methods of the generic Deck in the Components library
MyController.Deck.prototype = new components.Deck();
```

## Component

The basic building block of the library are Component objects that represent a
physical component of a controller, such as a button, knob, fader, or encoder.
The JavaScript object encapsulates all the information needed to receive MIDI
input from that component and send MIDI signals out to the controller to
activate its LED(s).

Components should generally be properties of a
[ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers) object. Most
Components should be properties of a custom [\#Deck](#deck) object as
demonstrated in the example in the previous section.

In general, you should not use the basic Component constructor directly;
instead, use one of its subtypes ([Button](#button), [Pot](#pot), or
[Encoder](#encoder)). If you do need to use Component directly, do not confuse
it with the `components` object (plural, lower case) that contains all the
objects for the library; access Component as `components.Component` (plural
lower case then singular upper case).

### Component Setup

The input function of each Component needs to be mapped to the incoming MIDI
signals in the XML file. For example:

```xml
<control>
    <group>[Channel1]</group>
    <!-- MyController.leftDeck would be an instance of a custom Deck. -->
    <key>MyController.leftDeck.quantizeButton.input</key>
    <status>0x90</status>
    <midino>0x01</midino>
    <options>
        <script-binding/>
    </options>
</control>
```

In the future Mixxx will be able to [register MIDI inputs from
JavaScript](registering-midi-input-handlers-from-javascript), so that will not
be necessary. Until then, if you decide to rename a Component or map it to
different MIDI input signals, you need to edit the XML file and reload the
mapping in Mixxx's Preferences. The output does not need to be mapped in XML. It
is handled by the library in JavaScript.

Create Components by calling the constructor with JavaScript's `new` keyword.
The Component constructor takes a single object as an argument. Generally you
should provide this as an [object
literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals).
Each property of that object passed to the constructor becomes a property of the
new Component object, making it easy to customize the functionality of the
Component. The constructors for all Component subtypes work the same way. Most
Components need at least these properties defined:

- `midi` (array with 2 numbers): the first two MIDI bytes that the controller
    sends/receives when the physical component changes state. Refer to the [MIDI
    Crash Course](MIDI-Crash-Course) if you do not understand what this means.
- `inKey` (string): the key of the [Mixxx
    ControlObject](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html)
    that this Component manipulates when it receives a MIDI input signal
- `outKey` (string): when the [Mixxx
    ControlObject](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html)
    specified by this key changes value, the `output` function will be called
- `group` (string): the group of the [Mixxx
    ControlObjects](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html)
    for both inKey and outKey, for example `[Channel1]` for deck 1

For example:

```javascript
var quantizeButton = new components.Button({
    midi: [0x91, 0x01],
    group: '[Channel1]'
    inKey: 'quantize',
    outKey: 'quantize',
});
```

If `inKey` and `outKey` are the same, you can specify `key` in the options
object for the constructor to set both the `inKey` and `outKey` properties of
the new Component. For example:

```javascript
var quantizeButton = new components.Button({
    midi: [0x91, 0x01],
    group: '[Channel1]',
    key: 'quantize',
});
```

Setting the `key` property after calling the constructor will not automatically
set `inKey` and `outKey`; you would need to do that manually if necessary.

### Methods

The following methods (in JavaScript, methods are just object properties that
happen to be functions) must be defined for every Component, but in most cases
the defaults (from the inherited prototype Component) will work so you do not
need to define them yourself:

- `input`: the [function that receives MIDI
    input](midi-scripting#midi-input-handling-functions)
- `output`: the [function that gets called when outKey changes
    value](midi-scripting#connect-output-callback-functions). Typically this
    sends MIDI output to the controller to change the state of an LED, but it
    can do anything.
- `connect`: register `output` as the callback function that gets executed when
    the value of the [Mixxx
    ControlObject](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html)
    specified by `group`, `outKey` changes. This is called automatically by the
    Component constructor if `group` and `outKey` are defined (otherwise it
    needs to be called after construction). Implement a custom function if you
    need to connect callbacks for multiple Mixxx ControlObjects in one
    Component. Refer to the source code of
    [SamplerButton.prototype.connect](#samplerbutton) for an example.

The following methods are called by the default Component `input` and `output`
methods, as well as the default `input` functions of [Button](#button),
[Pot](#pot), and [Encoder](#encoder). If you do not need to implement complex
custom behavior, you can overwrite these instead of the default `input` and
`output` methods:

- `inValueScale`: takes the third byte of the incoming MIDI signal as its first
    argument and returns the value to set `group`, `inKey` to
- `outValueScale`: takes the value of `group`, `outKey` as its first argument
    and returns the third byte of the outgoing MIDI signal

Each Component also has these methods that you probably should not overwrite:

- `disconnect`: disconnect the `output` function from being called when `group`,
    `outKey` changes
- `trigger`: manually call `output` with the same arguments as if `group`,
    `outKey` had changed
- `send`: send a 3 byte (short) MIDI message out to the controller. The first
    two bytes of the MIDI message are specified by the Component's `midi`
    property. The third MIDI byte is provided as the first argument to the
    `send` function.
- `inGetParameter`: returns the value of `group`, `inKey` normalized to a 0-1
    scale
- `inSetParameter`: sets the value of `group`, `inKey` to the function's first
    argument, normalized to a 0-1 scale
- `inGetValue`: returns the value of `group`, `inKey`
- `inSetValue`: sets the value of `group`, `inKey` to the function's first
    argument
- `inToggle`: sets `group`, `inKey` to its inverse (0 if it is \>0; 1 if it is
    0)
- `outGetParameter`: returns the value of `group`, `outKey` normalized to a 0-1
    scale
- `outSetParameter`: sets the value of `group`, `outKey` to the function's first
    argument, normalized to a 0-1 scale
- `outGetValue`: returns the value of `group`, `outKey`
- `outSetValue`: sets the value of `group`, `outKey` to the function's first
    argument
- `outToggle`: sets `group`, `outKey` to its inverse (0 if it is \>0; 1 if it is
    0)

### Optional properties

The following properties can be specified in the options object passed to the
Component constructor to customize the Component's initialization. Changing
their value after creating the Component does not do anything.

- `outConnect` (boolean, default true): whether to call `connect` in the
    constructor (assuming `group` and `outKey` were specified in the options
    object)
- `outTrigger` (boolean, default true): whether to call `trigger` in the
    constructor (assuming `group` and `outKey` were specified in the options
    object)

Some controllers send and receive two sets of MIDI signals for most physical
components, one for when the shift button is pressed and one for when the shift
button is not pressed. To avoid defining two Components for every physical
component of your controller, set the following options as appropriate:

- `sendShifted` (boolean, default false): whether to send a second, shifted MIDI
    message for every call to `send`
- `shiftChannel` (boolean, default false): whether the shifted MIDI message
    changes the MIDI channel (second nybble of the first byte of the MIDI
    signal)
- `shiftControl` (boolean, default false): whether the shifted MIDI message
    changes the MIDI control number (second byte) of the MIDI signal
- `shiftOffset` (number, default 0): how much to shift the MIDI channel or
    control number by

To avoid having to define those properties for every Component, you can change
the properties of `components.Component.prototype` in your controller's `init`
function. For example:

```javascript
components.Component.prototype.shiftOffset = 3;
components.Component.prototype.shiftChannel = true;
components.Component.prototype.sendShifted = true;
```

### Syntactic sugar

Components JS provides convenient shortcuts for common situations.

To avoid typing out the group for the constructor of each Component, Components
that share a group can be part of a ComponentContainer and the
[ComponentContainer's](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers)
`reconnectComponents` method can assign the group to all of them. Refer to the
[\#Deck](#deck) ComponentContainer documentation for an example.

If a Component only needs its `midi` property specified for its constructor,
this can be provided simply as an array without wrapping it in an object. For
example:

```javascript
var playButton = new components.PlayButton([0x90 + channel, 0x0A]);
```

instead of

```javascript
var playButton = new components.PlayButton({
    midi: [0x90 + channel, 0x0A]
});
```

## Button

A Button is a subtype of Component for buttons/pads. Subtypes of Button are
provided for many common use cases, documented in the subsections below, making
it easy to map those buttons without having to worry about particularities of
Mixxx's ControlObjects. To use the Button subtypes, you only need to specify
their `midi` and `group` properties, except for HotcueButton and SamplerButton.

A generic Button toggles the state of a binary `inKey` and sends outgoing MIDI
messages indicating whether a binary `outKey` is on or off. Button adds the
following properties to Component:

- `type`: determines the behavior of the Button. Can be any of these values:
  - `Button.prototype.types.push` (default): set inKey to 1 on button press and
    0 on button release. For example, use this type with the beatloop\_activate
    [Control](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html)
  - `Button.prototype.types.toggle`: invert value of inKey on button press. Use
    this with Controls whose values indicate the state of a switch, for example
    pfl
  - `Button.prototype.types.powerWindow`: like toggle, but toggles the value of
    inKey again on button up when long pressed, for example with
    \[EffectRack1\_EffectUnit2\_Effect1\], enabled Control.
- `on` (number, default 127): number to send as the third byte of outgoing MIDI
    messages when `group`, `outKey` is on (its value is \> 0)
- `off` (number, default 0): number to send as the third byte of outgoing MIDI
    messages when `group`, `outKey` is off (its value is 0)
- `isPress` (function): function that takes the same first 4 arguments as a MIDI
    input function (channel, control, value, status) and returns a boolean
    indicating whether the button was pressed.

For buttons/pads with multicolor LEDs, you can change the color of the LED by
defining the `on` and `off` properties to be the MIDI value to send for that
state. For example, if the LED turns red when sent a MIDI value of 127 and blue
when sent a value of 126:

```javascript
MyController.padColors = {
    red: 127,
    blue: 126
};
MyController.quantize = new components.Button({
    midi: [0x91, 0x01],
    group: '[Channel1]',
    key: 'quantize',
    type: components.Button.prototype.types.toggle,
    on: MyController.padColors.red,
    off: MyController.padColors.blue,
});
```

The default `isPress` function works for controllers that indicate whether a
button is pressed or released by sending a different third MIDI byte (value).
Some controllers distinguish between a button press and release by changing the
first nybble (hexadecimal digit) of the first byte of the MIDI message, also
known as an opcode. These controllers typically use an opcode of 9 to indicate a
button press and 8 to indicate a button release. Both the press and release
signals need to be mapped in the XML file to the Button's `input` method. To
make Button work for such a controller, reimplement the prototype `isPress`
function:

```javascript
components.Button.prototype.isPress = function(channel, control, value, status) {
    return (status & 0xF0) === 0x90;
}
```

### PlayButton

Default behavior: play/pause Shift behavior: reverse playback

LED behavior depends on cue mode selected by the user in the preferences Refer
to the
[manual](http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/user_interface.html#interface-cue-modes)
for details.

### CueButton

Default behavior: depends on cue mode configured by the user in the preferences
Shift behavior: stop playback and go to start of track Refer to the
[manual](http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/user_interface.html#interface-cue-modes)
for details.

### SyncButton

Default behavior: momentary sync without toggling sync lock Shift behavior:
toggle sync lock (master sync)

### HotcueButton

Default behavior: set hotcue if it is not set. If it is set, jump to it. Shift
behavior: delete hotcue

The LED indicates whether the hotcue is set.

Pass the number of the hotcue as the `number` property of the options argument
for the constructor. For example:

```javascript
var hotcues = [];
for (var i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
    hotcues[i] = new components.HotcueButton({
        number: i,
        group: '[Channel1]',
        midi: [0x91, 0x26 + i],
    });
}
```

#### Hotcue colors

HotcueButton can show hotcue colors on the controller. There are three ways of
implementing this. Which one to choose depends on the controller.

1. Set color via single byte based on controller internal palette
2. Set color via SysEx based on custom palette.
3. Set color via SysEx based on predefined colors by Mixxx.

Option 1 is the simplest and most common method for most controllers. You must
figure out which MIDI values correspond to which colors and the correlate it
with the [predefined hotcue colors](Hotcue-Colors) (the controller's manual from
the manufacturer may document this). Creating such HotcueButton could look like
this:

```javascript
var hotcueButton = new components.HotcueButton({
    number: 1,
    group: '[Channel1]',
    midi: [0x91, 0x26],
    // key-value map to correlate the Mixxx ColorID
    // with the value the controller expects for
    // specific colors. These values are passed to
    // the HotcueButton's send method.
    colors: {
        0: 0x10,
        1: 0x18,
        2: 0x20,
        ...
    },
    // value to turn off the buttons LED.
    off: 0x00,
});
```

With the second option, you can send predefined colors from the palette to the
controller but this time via SysEx. Since SysEx is very controller specific, it
is mandatory to specify a custom `sendRGB` method which is responsible for
taking a color description, extracting the relevant information, and sending the
SysEx Message to the controller. In this case, the values of the attributes in
the `colors` object are passed as the input to the `sendRGB` method.

```javascript
var hotcueButton = new components.HotcueButton({
    number: 1,
    group: '[Channel1]',
    midi: [0x91, 0x26],
    // key-value map to correlate the Mixxx ColorID
    // with an array which contains (in this case)
    // the RGB components of a color. These values
    // are passed as input to the sendRGB method.
    colors: {
        0: [0x00,0x00,0x00], // black
        1: [0xFF,0x00,0x00], // pure red
        2: [0xFF,0xFF,0x00], // pure Yellow
        ...
    },
    sendRGB: function (color_obj) {
        // example Message (hardcoded bytes are controller specific).
    // colors entries contain 8-bit values, but SysEx only supports 7-bit values
    // so were bitshifting by 1 to reduce the resolution.
        var msg = [0xF0, 0x00, 0x01, color_obj[0]>>1,color_obj[1]>>1,color_obj[2]>>1];
        // send message
    midi.sendSysexMsg(msg, msg.length);
    }
});
```

The third option is similar to the second one. You need to define a `sendRGB`
method again, but in this Mixxx provides the color palette automatically and you
do not provide a `colors` object for the HotcueButton. The `sendRGB(color)`
method gets passed a color object (more on the color API
[here](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/midi-scripting#color-api)). Such a
button could be defined like this:

```javascript
var hotcueButton = new components.HotcueButton({
    number: 1,
    group: '[Channel1]',
    midi: [0x91, 0x26],
    // colors automatically assigned by Components.JS framework
    sendRGB: function (color_obj) {
        // example Message (hardcoded bytes are controller specific).
    // colors entries contain 8-bit values, but SysEx only supports 7-bit values
    // so were bitshifting by 1 to reduce the resolution.
        var msg = [0xF0, 0x00, 0x01, color_obj.red>>1,color_obj.green>>1,color_obj.blue>>1];
        // send message
    midi.sendSysexMsg(msg, msg.length);
    }
});
```

### SamplerButton

Default behavior: Press the button to load the track selected in the library
into an empty sampler. Press a loaded sampler to play it from its cue point.
Press again while playing to jump back to the cue point. Shift behavior: If the
sampler is playing, stop it. If the sampler is stopped, eject it.

Specify the sampler number as the number property of the object passed to the
constructor. There is no need to manually specify the group. For example:

```javascript
var samplerButtons = [];
for (var n = 1; n <= 8; n++) {
    samplerButtons[n] = new components.SamplerButton({
        number: n,
        midi: [0x91, 0x02],
    });
};
```

You can also make the SamplerButtons velocity sensitive by setting the
`volumeByVelocity: true` property on the object that gets passed to the
constructor. This will change the volume at which the sample is being played at
depending on how hard you pressed the button. Obviously, it will only work if
your hardware features velocity sensitive buttons.

```javascript
var samplerButtons = [];
for (var n = 1; n <= 8; n++) {
    samplerButtons[n] = new components.SamplerButton({
        number: n,
        midi: [0x91, 0x02],
        volumeByVelocity: true,
    });
};
```

When the sampler is loaded, the LED will be sent a MIDI message with the value
of the `on` property (default 127) When the sampler is empty, the LED will be
sent a MIDI message with the value of the `off` property (default 0). If your
controller's pads have multicolor LEDs, specify the value to send for a
different LED color with the `playing` property to set the LED to a different
color while the sampler is playing. For example:

```javascript
MyController.padColors = {
// These values are just examples, consult the MIDI documentation from your controller's
// manufacturer to find the values for your controller. If that information is not available,
// guess and check to find the values.
    red: 125,
    blue: 126,
    purple: 127,
    off: 0
};
var samplerButton = [];
var samplerButton[1] = new components.SamplerButton({
    midi: [0x91, 0x02],
    number: 1,
    on: MyController.padColors.blue,
    playing: MyController.padColors.red,
    // off is inherited from Button.prototype
});
```

### EffectAssignmentButton

An EffectAssignmentButton routes a deck through an EffectUnit. It is separate
from the [EffectUnit](#effectunit) ComponentContainer because it is-meant to be
a part of a [Deck](#deck). Using `Deck.setCurrentDeck` to switch decks will
switch the deck an EffectAssignmentButton assigns an EffectUnit to.

```javascript
var effectAssignmentButtons = [];
for (var u = 1; u <= 4; u++) {
    effectAssignmentButtons = new components.EffectAssignmentButton({
        midi: [0x92, 0x20 + u],
        effectUnit: u,
        group: '[Channel1]',
    });
}
```

## Pot

A Pot is a Component subtype for potentiometers (faders and knobs) with finite
ranges. Pot's `connect` and `disconnect` methods take care of soft takeover when
switching layers with
[ComponentContainer's](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers)
`reconnectComponents` or `applyLayer` methods. Soft takeover is not activated
until the first input signal is received, so it does not interfere with setting
initial values for controllers that can report that information.

For example:

```javascript
var eqKnobs = [];
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    eqKnobs[i] = new components.Pot({
        midi: [0xB1, 0x02 + i],
        group: '[EqualizerRack1_[Channel1]_Effect1]',
        inKey: 'parameter' + i,
    });
}
```

To use a Pot with a fader or knob that uses 14 bit MIDI (sends two MIDI
messages, one with a least significant byte and one with a most significant
byte) for higher precision, map the incoming signals to the Pot's `inputLSB` and
`inputMSB` functions instead of `input` in the XML file. Nothing extra needs to
be done in JavaScript.

The Pot components supports `max` values up to 16384 (`2^14`). So if (for some
obscure reason) a control only sends 6 bytes of precision, you can map `input`
as if the control had 7 bits of precision and then specify `max: 64`. The same
would work for 10 bits for example, just map `inputLSB` and `inputMSB` as if the
control sent 14 bits of precision and then specify `max: 1024`.

Pot Components support an optional relative mode as an alternative to dealing
with soft takeover. To use it, set the `relative` property to `true` in the
options object for the constructor. In this mode, moving the Pot will adjust the
Mixxx Control relative to its current value. For example:

```javascript
var tempoFader = new components.Pot({
    midi: [0xB1, 0x32],
    group: '[Channel1]',
    inKey: 'rate',
    relative: true,
});
```

## Encoder

Encoder is a Component for infinitely turning encoders. The default `input`
function assumes the encoder sends MIDI signals on a continous scale from 0 to
127 (0x7F). If the encoder sends relative MIDI signals to indicate whether it
turns right or left, you will need to define your own `input` function. For
example, for an encoder that sends a value of 1 when it is turned left and a
value of 127 when it is turned right:

```javascript
MyController.SomeEncoder = new components.Encoder({
    midi: [0xB1, 0x03],
    group: '[Channel1]',
    inKey: 'pregain',
    input: function (channel, control, value, status, group) {
        if (value === 1) {
            this.inSetParameter(this.inGetParameter() - .05);
        } else if (value === 127) {
            this.inSetParameter(this.inGetParameter() + .05);
        }
    },
});
```

To map an Encoder with an LED ring around it that receives MIDI signals on a
continuous 0-127 scale, define an `outKey` property in the options object for
the constructor. Similar to `input`, if the LEDs do not respond to a continuous
0-127 scale, define your own `output` function. If `outKey` and `inKey` are the
same, you can just specify one `key` property for the constructor.

Encoders can often be pushed like a button. Usually, it is best to use a
separate Button Component to handle the MIDI signals from pushing it.

### JogWheelBasic

Since mapping [Jogwheels in mixxx can be
cumbersome](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/midi-scripting#scratching-and-jog-wheels)
we introduced a new component called `JogWheelBasic` in Mixxx 2.3.4.

```js
this.jogWheel = components.JogWheelBasic({
  deck: 1, // whatever deck this jogwheel controls
  wheelResolution: 1000, // how many ticks per revolution the jogwheel has
  alpha: 1/8 // alpha-filter
  beta: 1/8/32 // optional
  rpm: 33 + 1/3 // optional
  group: // optional
});
```

See the [Jogwheel
guide](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/midi-scripting#scratching-and-jog-wheels)
on a more in-depth explanation of the available properties. The XML should map
`jogWheel.inputWheel` to the messages containing rotation information of the
wheel and `jogWheel.inputTouch` on messages that contain info on whether the top
of the platter was touched. If you need to make some adjustments how the wheel
interprets the incoming rotation information, you can overwrite
`onValueScale(midiValue)`. If your controller has an option to enable/disable
vinylmode, you can set `jogWheel.vinylMode` and the controller will behave
appropriately (touching the jogwheel platter is ignored when `vinylMode` is
`false`).

## ComponentContainer and Managing Layers

A ComponentContainer is an object that contains Components as properties.
ComponentContainer has methods to easily iterate through the Components, which
makes it easy to manage different layers of functionality. The basic
ComponentContainer methods are:

- `forEachComponent`: Iterate over all Components in this ComponentContainer and
    perform an operation on them. The operation is a function provided as the
    first argument to `forEachComponent`. The operation function takes each
    Component as its first argument. In the context of the operation function,
    `this` refers to the ComponentContainer. `forEachComponent` iterates
    recursively through the Components in any ComponentContainers and arrays
    that are properties of this ComponentContainer. If you do not want
    `forEachComponent` to operate recursively, pass `false` as the second
    argument to `forEachComponent`.
- `reconnectComponents`: Call each Component's `disconnect` method, optionally
    perform an operation on it, then call its `connect` and `trigger` methods to
    sync the state of the controller's LEDs. Arguments are the same as
    `forEachComponent`.
- `shutdown`: Iterate over all Components and call their shutdown methods. The
    Button is the only component with a predefined shutdown method. All other
    components have to be implemented manually if they require anything to be
    done when Mixxx shuts down.

Typically, `reconnectComponents` is used to switch between layers. The callback
passed to reconnectComponents can manipulate each Component's properties as
appropriate for the new layer. Below is a basic example for switching between
decks 1 and 3. This is a simple example that does not handle the complexities
presented by EQs, QuickEffects, or EffectAssignmentButtons like
[Deck.setCurrentDeck](#deck) does.

```javascript
// Define a constructor for a ComponentContainer that adds some Components to it
var ExampleContainer = function () {
    this.play = new components.PlayButton({
        midi: [0x91, 0x40],
        group: '[Channel1]',
    });
    this.cue = new components.CueButton({
        midi: [0x91, 0x41],
        group: '[Channel1]',
    });
};
// This will give any object created with "new exampleContainer()"
// the ComponentContainer methods.
exampleContainer.prototype = new components.ComponentContainer();

var demonstration = new ExampleContainer();
demonstration.reconnectComponents(function (component) {
    component.group = '[Channel3]';
)};
```

In simple cases like the demonstration above, changing a property of each
Component in the callback passed to `reconnectComponents` is sufficient. When
more complex manipulation is required, especially if the manipulation varies
between Components, it is a good idea to use the `reconnectComponents` callback
to call a specific method on each Component. This keeps all the logic for that
Component together instead of scattering it between the Component construction
and the layer switching function.

### Shift layers

The most common use case for changing layers is for shift buttons. If your
controller sends different MIDI signals depending on whether shift is pressed,
map both the shifted and unshifted input signals to the Component's `input`
function in XML. For each Component that has different behavior depending on
whether shift is pressed, implement `shift` and `unshift` methods that
manipulate the Component appropriately. When the shift button is pressed call
`ComponentContainer.shift()` and the shift method of each Component in the
ComponentContainer will be executed (if it exists). When the shift button is
released, call `ComponentContainer.unshift()` to call each Component's `unshift`
method.

Note that any *Button.prototype.types.push* type [Buttons](#button) in the
ComponentContainer will have their inKey reset to 0 if the user happens to have
them pressed when `ComponentContainer.shift()` or `ComponentContainer.unshift()`
is called. This prevents the Button's inKey from getting stuck in a pressed (1)
state, which can cause confusing behavior with some
[MixxxControls](https://manual.mixxx.org/latest/chapters/appendix/mixxx_controls.html).

For convenience, the Component constructor will automatically call the `unshift`
function if it exists. This allows you to avoid redundancy when constructing
Components.

To use separate `output` callback functions in shifted and unshifted modes, the
Component's `shift` and `unshift` functions need to call `disconnect`/`connect`
and `trigger`. ComponentContainer's `shift`/`unshift` methods will not do this
automatically like `reconnectComponents`.

Generally, you should avoid making LEDs change when a shift button is pressed.
This is distracting if the user is pressing shift to use the shifted
functionality of a different part of the controller. If the alternate layer is
confined to a specific part of the controller, changing LEDs is not an issue.

To handle the interaction of shifted and unshifted states with another layer,
you can create another system of methods for each Component that changes
properties of the Component when a layer is activated, and within those methods,
you can assign the `shift` and `unshift` properties of the Component to
different functions. Refer to the source code of [\#EffectUnit](#effectunit) for
an example.

## Deck

Deck is a [\#ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers) with
methods for conveniently changing the `group` attributes of contained Components
to switch the deck that a set of Components is manipulating. The
`setCurrentDeck` method takes the new deck as a string and sets the Components'
`group` property appropriately, including for equalizer knobs and QuickEffect
(filter) knobs.

The Deck constructor takes one argument, which is an array of deck numbers to
cycle through with the `toggle` method. Typically this will be `[1, 3]` or `[2,
4]`.

Refer to the [\#File structure](#file-structure) section above for an example.

## EffectUnit

EffectUnit is a [\#ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers)
that contains Components designed to be mapped to the common arrangement of 4
knobs and 4 buttons for controlling effects. If your controller's effects
section has fewer components, the EffectUnit object provided by Components JS
probably will not be very helpful. You may want to read the source code for the
library's EffectUnit to get an idea for how to map your controller though.

There is no need to use Components for the rest of your mapping if you just want
to use the EffectUnit from the library.

The Components provided are:

- dryWetKnob ([\#Pot](#pot))
- effectFocusButton ([\#Button](#button))
- enableButtons\[1-3\]
    ([\#ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers) of
    [\#Button](#button)s)
- knobs\[1-3\] ([\#ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers)
    of [\#Pot](#pot)s)

Refer to the [Standard Effects Mapping](Standard-Effects-Mapping) page for a
description of how to use the EffectUnit object. On the wiki page for your
controller, link to the [Standard Effects Mapping](Standard-Effects-Mapping)
page instead of rewriting a description for your controller.

### EffectUnit Setup

To map an EffectUnit for your controller, call the constructor like the
[\#Deck](#deck) constructor. The only argument to the constructor is an array of
numbers that specifies which EffectUnits pressing the effectFocusButton with
shift toggles between. Then, set the midi attributes for the
showParametersButton, enableButtons\[1-3\], and optionally
enableOnChannelButtons. After the `midi` attributes are set up, call the
EffectUnit's `init` method to set up the output callbacks. For example:

```javascript
MyController.effectUnit = new components.EffectUnit([1, 3]);
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[1].midi = [0x90, 0x01];
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[2].midi = [0x90, 0x02];
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[3].midi = [0x90, 0x03];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[1].midi = [0xB0, 0x01];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[2].midi = [0xB0, 0x02];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[3].midi = [0xB0, 0x03];
MyController.effectUnit.dryWetKnob.midi = [0xB0, 0x04];
MyController.effectUnit.effectFocusButton.midi = [0x90, 0x04];
MyController.effectUnit.init();
```

Controllers designed for Serato and Rekordbox often have an encoder instead of a
dry/wet knob (labeled "Beats" for Serato or "Release FX" for Rekordbox) and a
button labeled "Tap". Map the `effectFocusButton` to the controller's "Tap"
button. To use the `dryWetKnob` Pot with an encoder, replace its `input`
function with a function that can appropriately handle the signals sent by your
controller. For example:

```javascript
MyController.effectUnit = new components.EffectUnit([1, 3]);
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[1].midi = [0x90, 0x01];
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[2].midi = [0x90, 0x02];
MyController.effectUnit.enableButtons[3].midi = [0x90, 0x03];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[1].midi = [0xB0, 0x01];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[2].midi = [0xB0, 0x02];
MyController.effectUnit.knobs[3].midi = [0xB0, 0x03];
MyController.effectUnit.dryWetKnob.midi = [0xB0, 0x04];
MyController.effectUnit.dryWetKnob.input = function (channel, control, value, status, group) {
    if (value === 1) {
       // 0.05 is an example. Adjust that value to whatever works well for your controller.
       this.inSetParameter(this.inGetParameter() - .05);
    } else if (value === 127) {
       this.inSetParameter(this.inGetParameter() + .05);
    }
};
MyController.effectUnit.effectFocusButton.midi = [0x90, 0x04];
MyController.effectUnit.init();
```

For the shift functionality to work, the shift button of your controller must be
mapped to a function that calls the `shift`/`unshift` methods of the EffectUnit
on button press/release. Also, if your controller sends different MIDI signals
when shift is pressed, map those as well as the unshifted signals to the `input`
method of each Component in your XML file. If the EffectUnit is a property of
another [\#ComponentContainer](#componentcontainer-and-managing-layers) (for
example a [\#Deck](#deck)), calling `shift` and `unshift` on the parent
ComponentContainer will recursively call it on the EffectUnit too (just like it
will for any other ComponentContainer).

By default an effect can only be focused when the respective GUI unit is
expanded: when the focus button of a collapsed unit is pressed, the GUI
counterpart is expanded. Accordingly, units release the effect focus and switch
back to Meta knob mapping as soon as an unit is collapsed. However, there are
situations when the on-screen parameters of a focused effect can safely stay
hidden while the controller is mapped to the parameter knobs. Collapsed units
show a focus indicator then. To enable this mode instatiate effect units with
'true' added after the effect unit numbers array. For example:

```javascript
MyController.effectUnit = new components.EffectUnit([1, 3],true);
//...
```

### Assignment switches

Generally, most controllers should use
[EffectAssignmentButton](#effectassignmentbutton)s in [Deck](#deck)s to enable
effect units on decks. If you have a dedicated effects controller that does not
manipulate decks, the enableOnChannelButtons provided by EffectUnit would be
more appropriate. You can easily create these by calling
`enableOnChannelButtons.addButton('CHANNEL_NAME')` (do not put brackets around
the CHANNEL\_NAME) on the EffectUnit object, then define their `midi`
properties.
