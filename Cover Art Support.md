## Cover Art Support

Over the years a highly requested feature has been for Mixxx to support
displaying cover art. This is a great project that combines both
aesthetics/design and engineering. Can you think of awesome, playful
ways to display cover art?

Some topics your proposal should cover:

  - Supporting loading cover art (from metadata tags, from cover images
    in album directories, etc.)
  - Deciding where and how to display the cover art in the GUI. 
  - Downloading cover art from metadata sources on the Internet if it is
    not available locally.

Your proposal should at the very least include details of how you will
accomplish each of these parts of the project but the project is by no
means limited to these topics. Make sure to think through the whole
design and implementation and be sure to include details of anything you
think may be relevant.

Since this project is small in scope, we expect that you will have
plenty of time to polish it and make it shine.
