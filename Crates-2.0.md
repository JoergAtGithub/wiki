# Summary

This blueprint aims at bringing to Mixxx two new crates features:
folders of crates and smart crates. It is a good idea to design this two
features together because they are highly coupled.

(Ferran Pujol, 3/4/15) I'm currently finishing a detailed design and
work breakdown. I'll upload it when it is ready.
