# Custom caps

Most DJ gear comes with black or grey knobs and fader caps. Several
companies sell brightly colored knobs and fader caps that can replace
the standard black or grey that your gear came with. In addition to
looking cool, brighter caps can be easier to see in dark environments.
Some caps have a hard plastic slippery surface whereas others have a
rubberized surface that fingers don't slide off as much. Some DJs prefer
plastic; some prefer rubberized surfaces. Be sure to check that the caps
you order fit your controller before purchasing them.
