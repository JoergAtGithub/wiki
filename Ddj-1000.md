#### List of MIDI messages

DDJ-1000 List of midi messages:

  - [here](https://github.com/pestrela/music/blob/master/ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes/DDJ-1000RB%20-%20MIDI%20Messages.pdf)

Undocumented messages:

  - PC APP Connect: ch 16 note A-1 (=message 9)
  - This queries the physical position of the faders etc

#### Differences between MIDI mode and HID mode

(note1: IN/OUT is from the point of view of the software)  
(note2: HID tests done in virtual DJ, to have different software FX than
the hardware ones)  
(note3: MIDI messages and Bugfixes can be manipulated by the firmware or
by the Driver)

BeatFX ON/OFF button:

1.  MIDI:
    1.  OUT: This button has its own state machine. It doesn't react to
        sending a MIDI message, so we can't reset it
    2.  IN: There is no visibility of the blinking status. Pressing the
        button always output a TOGGLE message
2.  HID: VirtualDJ has full control

BeatFX Screen:

1.  MIDI: No visibility or control. The screen always shows the Pioneer
    effects and their values. These Pioneer effects are ONLY applied on
    the master channel
2.  HID: VirtualDJ has full control. Master channel is VDJ effects. If
    an analog source is choose, the Pioneer effects return for that
    channel.

SoundColorFX buttons:

1.  MIDI: 
    1.  IN: button blinks by itself, even when using shift+button 
    2.  OUT: button reacts to stop blinking
2.  HID: Unknown

JogScreens:

1.  MIDI:
    1.  OUT: fair amount of controls. Sync led doesn't react (firmware
        bug acknowledged by support)
2.  HID:
    1.  OUT: adds Waveforms, tempo range, cuescope, cover art

Pad Page:

1.  MIDI: 

<!-- end list -->

``` 
   - IN: it has its own state machine, per pad mode
   - OUT: no reaction
- HID: Full control; Hotcues have 2 subpages; Loops mode have >4 sub-pages  
```

Deck select:

1.  MIDI: 
    1.  IN: no visibility on the active deck; the firmware always return
        channel 3/4 regardless of the active channel. The active channel
        needs to be inferred by later messages.
    2.  OUT: no reaction
2.  HID: unknown 

Dual USB:

1.  MIDI:
    1.  Input select: these are received in both USB ports
    2.  Deck messages: these are filtered by the firmware. Receiving
        deck messages + Input select is the only way to know which USB
        you are (see below)
    3.  Mixer controls: all messages are sent to both USB ports. This is
        teh case even for shared controls like the crossfader. Thus it
        needs software filtering

<!-- end list -->

``` 
     * crossfader
     * gain, volume, EQ
     * colorFX buttons
     * all beatFX (including dry/wet)
     * Filter knob
- HID: Confirmed that Rekordbox and Virtual can share a controller just fine

```

#### Pioneer hardware effects

The DDJ-1000 controller runs in internal mode, so hardware effects are
only supported for beatFX master channel and analog sources. No colorFX,
no per-channel USB effects. Compare to the DDJ-1000SRT that runs in
external mode, so it has all colorFX and beatFX to all sources.

| Input             | ColorFX | BeatFX channel | BeatFX master |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 1000 + MIXXX      | **NO**  | **NO**         | yes           |
| 1000 + line-in    | yes     | yes            | yes           |
|                   |         |                |               |
| 1000SRT + MIXXX   | yes     | yes            | yes           |
| 1000SRT + line-in | yes     | yes            | yes           |
