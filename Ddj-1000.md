DDJ-1000 List of midi messages:
[here](https://github.com/pestrela/music/blob/master/ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes/DDJ-1000RB%20-%20MIDI%20Messages.pdf)

(note1: IN/OUT is from the point of view of the software)  
(note2: tests done in virtual DJ)

BeatFX ON/OFF button:

1.  MIDI:
    1.  OUT: This button has its own state machine. It doesn't react to
        sending a MIDI message, so we can't reset it
    2.  IN: There is no visibility of the blinking status. Pressing the
        button always output a TOGGLE message
2.  HID: VirtualDJ has full control

BeatFX Screen:

1.  MIDI: No visibility or control. The screen always shows the Pioneer
    effects and their values. These Pioneer effects are ONLY applied on
    the master channel
2.  HID: VirtualDJ has full control. Master channel is VDJ effects. If
    an analog source is choose, the Pioneer effects return for that
    channel.

SoundColorFX buttons:

1.  MIDI: 
    1.  IN: button blinks by itself, even when using shift+button 
    2.  OUT: button reacts to stop blinking
2.  HID: Unknown

JogScreens:

1.  MIDI:
    1.  OUT: fair amount of controls. Sync led doesn't react (firmware
        bug acknowledged by support)
2.  HID:
    1.  OUT: adds Waveforms, tempo range, cuescope, cover art

Deck select:

1.  MIDI: 
    1.  IN: no visibility on the active deck; the firmware always return
        channel 3/4 regardless of the active channel. The active channel
        needs to be inferred by later messages.
    2.  OUT: no reaction
2.  HID: unknown
