The Denon MC7000 is a professional DJ controller which has got 4-channel
capability and dual USB connections. These two USB audio interfaces
enable two DJs to play together. This controller includes Denon's high
build quality and superior 24-bit audio reproduction, makes this suited
to both mobile and club DJs.

The dual 6" platters have a touch-capacitive design with rotational LED
displays. The MC7000 has exclusive and dedicated Key Matching and
Changing controls that deliver an unprecedented ability to instantly and
harmonically match musical keys. The unitâ€™s comprehensive, multi-input
mixer also provides access to line/phono inputs from both authentic
analogue (vinyl) and digital sources.

COMPATIBILITY

  - Windows users need to install the Windows Driver from [Denon
    Download Site](https://www.denondj.com/downloads)
  - Mac users should be just fine connecting the MC7000 and go
  - Linux users need to know that the internal Sound device is not
    available due to non accepted USB Clock source. A workaround is
    available by just removing the clock source checking and recompile
    the kernel as described here:

    Kernel](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/compiling-linux-kernel-26.html)

When the Hardware is detected then you have got 2 outputs (Master/Booth
out and Headphone) as well as 3 Input devices for Microphones.

## Mapping

This controller is made for Serato DJ and most of the mapping is made
for MIXXX accordingly. Anyhow there are several changes made in order to
have a better experience. If you have any wishes to improve the mapping,
then please visit the forum and write them into the Denon MC7000 Mapping
thread.
