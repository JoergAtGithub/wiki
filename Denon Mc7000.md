## General

The Denon MC7000 is a professional DJ controller which has got 4-channel
capability and dual USB connections. These two USB audio interfaces
enable two DJs to play together. This controller includes Denon's high
build quality and superior 24-bit audio reproduction, makes this suited
to both mobile and club DJs.

The dual 6" platters have a touch-capacitive design with rotational LED
displays. The MC7000 has exclusive and dedicated Key Matching and
Changing controls that deliver an unprecedented ability to instantly and
harmonically match musical keys. The unit’s comprehensive, multi-input
mixer also provides access to line/phono inputs from both authentic
analogue (vinyl) and digital sources.

### Features

  - 4-channel DJ controller with digital mixer
  - Dual USB audio interfaces - connect 2 computers at once
  - 16 velocity-sensitive performance pads
  - New dedicated key-matching and changing controls
  - Solid 6-inch touch-capacitive platters with tracking LED
  - 2 mic inputs with dedicated controls
  - XLR Booth and Master connections

### Compatibility

  - Mac users should be just fine connecting the MC7000 and go.
  - Windows users need to install the Windows Driver from [Denon
    Download Site](https://www.denondj.com/downloads).
  - Linux users need to know that the MC7000 internal audio interface is
    not available out-of-the-box for older Linux Kernels. You should
    upgrade your Kernel to minimum versions LTS: 4.19.105 or 5.4.21,
    stable branch 5.5.5 or current 5.6 (valid at date 2020-02-19). Newer
    Kernels will surely also work.

8\. **Channel Fader:** Use this fader to adjust the channel’s volume
level.

9\. **Crossfader Assign:** Routes the audio playing on the corresponding
channel to either side of the crossfader (L or R), or bypasses the
crossfader and sends the audio directly to the program mix (center,
Thru).

10\. **Crossfader:** Use this crossfader to mix between the left and
right decks.

11\. **Channel FX:** Use these buttons to apply Effect A and/or B to the
corresponding channel.

12\. **Sampler Volume:** Turn this knob to adjust the volume level of
the software’s sampler. If the volume is set to 0 then the Sampler banks

(hardware).

22\. **Split Cue:** When this switch is in the On position, the
headphone audio will be “split” such that all channels sent to cue
channel are summed to mono and sent to the left headphone channel and
the master mix is summed to mono and sent to the right channel. When the
switch is in the Off position, the cue channel and master mix will be
“blended” together.

start of the track.

27\. **Play/Pause / Stutter:** This button pauses or resumes playback.
Press and hold Shift and then press this button to “stutter-play” the
track from the last set cue point.

28\. **Platter:** This capacitive, touch-sensitive platter controls the
audio playhead when the wheel is touched and moved. When the Vinyl
button is on, move the platter to “scratch” the track as you would with
a vinyl record. When the Vinyl button is off (or if you are touching
only the side of the platter), move the platter to temporarily adjust
the track’s speed.

29\. **Stop Time:** Controls the rate at which the track slows to a
complete stop (“brake time”) during backspin.

30\. **Vinyl:** Press this button to activate/deactivate a “vinyl mode”
for the platter. When activated, you can use the platter to “scratch”
the track as you would with a vinyl record.

31\. **Pitch Fader:** Move this fader to adjust the speed (pitch) of the

**HELP APPRECIATED**

44\. **Slip:** Press this button to enable or disable Slip Mode. In Slip
Mode, you can jump to cue points, trigger loop rolls, or use the
platters, while the track’s timeline continues. In other words, when you
stop the action, the track will resume normal playback from where it
would have been if you had never done anything (i.e., as if the track
had been playing forward the whole time).

45\. **Censor / Rev:** Press this button to activate the Backspin
feature. If the track did not stop yet then when you release the button,

the tracks in your library. Press the left side button to load a track
into the active Deck (1 or 3), press the right side button to load a
track into the active Deck (2 or 4). Press and hold Shift and push the
knob to open folders on the left side of the library.

49\. **Sort:** *will be implemented with MIXXX 2.3*

50\. **Back/Fwd/Sort BPM:** Press this button to move to the previous
window. Press and hold Shift and then press this button to move to the
next window. *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press this button
to sort the tracks by BPM.*

51\. **Load Prep/Open Prep/Sort Key:** Press this button to load the
currently selected track to the Preview Deck. Press and hold Shift and

Press and hold Sort and then press this button to sort the tracks by
key.*

52\. **Files/History/Sort Artist:** Press this to maximise the library.
*MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press this button to sort the
tracks by artist.*

53\. **Panel/View/Sort Title:** Press this to open and close the FX
section inside the GUI. *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press
this button to sort the tracks by title.*

54\. **Needle Drop Strip:** The length of this strip represents the
length of the entire track. Place your finger on a point along this
sensor to jump to that point in the track. Press and hold Shift to jump
to a position while a track is currently playing.

55\. **FX On / Select:** Press this button to turn the corresponding
effect on or off. Press and hold Shift and then press this button to
select an effect from the list that was enabled in the MIXXX Properties
FX section.

56\. **FX Level:** Turn this knob to adjust the level of the
corresponding effect. The FX On button under the knob must be lit for
this knob to function.

57\. **FX Beats:** Turn this knob to adjust the Wet/Dry rate of the
effects.

58\. **FX Tap:** Press this button will activate effects for the Master
Signal instead of the individual Decks. Press and hold Shift and then
press this button to have the effects also on the Headphone preview.

Front Panel. **Crossfader Contour:** Adjusts the slope of the crossfader
curve. Turn the knob to the left for a smooth fade (mixing) or to the
right for a sharp cut (scratching). The center position is a typical
setting. This seams to have a very minor effect in MIXXX.

### LEDs

The Channel Volume Meters matches to the ones shown in MIXXX GUI. Only
when clipping the red LED illuminates.

As mentioned before the Master Volume Meter is not correlated to MIXXX
GUI as the controller handles that in Hardware.

Button LEDs are fully mapped for the first function. As you press and
hold Shift then the secondary function has only got some mappings, e.g.
flashing TAP and KEY SYNC when activated.

Platter Ring LEDs are correlated with the VINYL button.

  - If VINYL Mode is set ON then the LED follows the 33.3 rpm value and
    is correlated with the platter movement too.
  - If VINYL Mode is set OFF the current track position is indicated by
    the Platter LEDs starting at the top.

### Change Log

**coming changes**

  - eject loaded Sampler using Shift + PAD button
  - "BEAT GRID - set" to be used for quantize

<!-- end list -->

``` 
* 
```

**Beta 0.12:**

  - first introduction of working PAD Modes
  - HOT CUE working
  - SAMPLER working

<!-- end list -->

  - known issues: 
  - Performance PAD LEDs are still not 100% working, especially if you
    are in different mode on both channels

### Wish List

All additional wishes will be listed here:

  - improve Platter Ring LED performance. Currently only 26 signals are
    sent for one complete turn around for 48 LEDs
  - let Platter Ring LEDs flash during the last minute (or other time
    period) of a track
