### The full mapping documentation has been moved to the [Mixxx User Manual](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/denon_mc7000.html) since Mixxx v 2.3.
I gonna maintain additional information here inside the Wiki for people who wanna get more information, alternative mappings or help to improve the functionality.

### How to get additional mappings

For MIXXX 2.2.4 and following the mapping will be included in the
Software. You don't need to download.

If you like to add a mapping manually for any other version then read on...

The version for MIXXX 2.2.2 or MIXXX 2.2.3 is on GitHub. You need both
files so please just right click each of the links and "save link as".

  - [Denon MC7000 Mapping \*.xml
    file](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/raw/2.2/res/controllers/Denon-MC7000.midi.xml)
  - [Denon MC7000 Mapping \*.js
    file](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/raw/2.2/res/controllers/Denon-MC7000-scripts.js)

I am continuously working on fine tuning and for testing you can find the latest development mapping here:
