## 2013-02-30

Now included inside the normal mixxx version\!

## 2011-01-30

New feature: shift + hotcue X when the hotcue X is not set -\> place the
hotcue ON the nearest beat Bug fix: all positions number (hotcues and
loop) are even

## 2011-01-17

New features:

  - no more button for scratch mode. Shift + vinyl is already a sort of
    "scratch mode". So in "scratch mode", you can scratch when you touch
    the top of the wheel and pitch when you touch the side of this one
    at the same time.
  - shift + auto loop when the loop is not set -\> create a one beat
    loop with the start point ON the nearest beat.
