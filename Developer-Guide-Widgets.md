The most of non skin-able GUI is created by using Qt-Widgets and the
QtDesigner wysiwyg editor.

[Using a Designer UI
file](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/designer-using-a-ui-file.html)

The UI files are used to autogenerated the c++ code that initializes the
GUI. In Mixxx we use the dlg\*.cpp files to receive events from these
GUI elements.

The
[dlghidden.ui](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/master/src/library/dlghidden.ui)
for instance builds the bar on top of the table with the hidden files in
the library region. The class using the generated widgets is
[dlghidden.cpp](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/master/src/library/dlghidden.cpp)

New UI files need to be introduced to scons via the
[depends.py](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/4c2f2403a34fded43ece3f443db2981fc5a1f5d2/build/depends.py#L1255)
file.
