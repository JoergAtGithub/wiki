# DJ headphones

DJ headphones are generally better quality than typical consumer
headphones. Importantly, they are designed to have good isolation,
meaning they block outside sound. This allows the DJ to focus on the
sound in the headphones better without having to turn up the volume to
drown out sound from the monitors, PA system, and chatter. Also, DJ
headphones have hinges or flexible headbands that allow the DJ to take
off one headphone cup to hear the monitor or PA output better in one ear
and compare it to the headphone output in the other ear.

When shopping for headphones, consider how well they isolate sound and
their durability. The most frequent places that headphones break are the
cable attachment point and the headband. Look for headphones with
detachable cables, metal headbands, and other individually replaceable
parts.

## In-ear monitors

In-ear monitors (IEMs) isolate sound better than headphones but are more
expensive. Good DJ headphones can be purchased new for $150-250; IEMs
with comparable sound quality cost $350-$1000. They may be a sound
investment for musicians who play often in very loud environments to
preserve their hearing.
