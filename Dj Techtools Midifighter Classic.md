The default Mixxx mapping has the buttons mapped to hotcues 1-8 for
decks 1 & 2.

This controller has been discontinued. A similar product, the [DJ

still available from [DJ
TechTools](https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-3d) and
includes a 3D motion sensor. The [DJ TechTools MIDI Fighter
Twister](DJ%20TechTools%20MIDI%20Fighter%20Twister) is another similar
product that features a 4x4 grid of infinitely rotating encoders with
push buttons surrounded by programmable LED rings and is also available
from [DJ
TechTools](https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister).
