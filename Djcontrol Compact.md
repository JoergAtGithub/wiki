# Hercules DJControl Compact

The Hercules DJControl Compact is a great, simple controller that works
well for basic two-channel mixing. Due to its small size, many buttons
perform more than one function. For instance although it doesn't have
rate sliders, the controller has two jog wheels which can also be used
to adjust the playback rate.

## Configuration

By default the two EQ knobs control midrange EQ and low EQ. The user may
decide to edit the mapping to make the first knob adjust high EQ instead
of midrange. Users can edit the XML file directly or use the midi
mapping wizard instead.

## Basic Use

The controller works in Mixxx in many ways identically to how the manual
describes:

## Mixxx-specific differences

  - The Auto button toggles Auto-DJ mode
  - The REC button toggles set recording
  - You can press and hold the sync buttons to engage Mixxx Master Sync

### Loop Buttons

In loop mode, the buttons are mapped in a way that's more artistically
expressive:

  - Button 1 enables and disables the loop
  - Button 2 enables a 2 bar loop
  - Button 3 divides the current loop in half
  - Button 4 doubles the length of the current loop
  - Shift + Button 1 performs an 1/8th bar roll
  - Shift + Button 2 performs an 1/4th bar roll
  - Shift + Button 3 performs an 1/2th bar roll
  - Shift + Button 4 performs an 1 bar roll

### FX Buttons

  - Button 1 enables and disables the first FX chain for Channel 1
  - Button 2 enables and disables the second FX chain for Channel 1
  - Button 1 enables and disables the first FX chain for Channel 2
  - Button 2 enables and disables the second FX chain for Channel 2

Shift-FX buttons are not mapped.

### Sampler Buttons

  - Button 1 plays Sample Deck 1
  - Button 2 plays Sample Deck 2
  - Button 3 plays Sample Deck 3
  - Button 4 plays Sample Deck 4
  - Shift + Button 1 stops Sample Deck 1 and puts the playhead at the
    cue point
  - Shift + Button 2 stops Sample Deck 2 and puts the playhead at the
    cue point
  - Shift + Button 3 stops Sample Deck 3 and puts the playhead at the
    cue point
  - Shift + Button 4 stops Sample Deck 4 and puts the playhead at the
    cue point

### Cue Buttons

  - Each button activates the hotcue with that number
  - Shift + button clears the hotcue with that number
