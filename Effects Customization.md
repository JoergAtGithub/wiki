### Abstract

This project focuses on the effects section of Mixxx. I will be
refactoring the effects section of Mixxx to support the integration of
*LV2* effects and implementing new features like:

  - Import/Export Effect Chains
  - Show/Hide Effect Parameters
  - Rearrange Effect Parameters
  - Set Custom Defaults and Ranges

### Proposed Timeline

##### Week 1 (May 14 - May 20)

During this week, I'll be working on effect blacklisting for LV2
effects. I will also start working on connecting EngineEffect\* and the
Effect\* classes if I have enough time during the end of the week.

I will be able to work during nights or early mornings during this week
because I have a workshop scheduled from May 15th to May 30th during the
days.

##### Week 2 (May 21 - May 27)

I aim to finish connecting EngineEffect\* classes to their corresponding
Effect\* classes during this week.

##### Week 3 (May 28 - June 3)

I will start working on the consolidating the slot classes into their
corresponding Effect\* classes during this week.

##### Week 4 (June 4 - June 10)

I will mainly focus on testing and documentation during this week.

#### Proposed Deadlines

##### May 21

Finish working on LV2 effects branch with effect blacklisting.

##### June 10

Finish working on the new effects architecture.
