## Summary

**Status**: This specification is **in drafting**. Please feel free to
edit this page.

DJs often augment their mixes with effects. Mixxx is severely lacking in
this department, as released versions of Mixxx only offer EQs and a
flanger.

This project aims to bring effects to Mixxx, both via native effects and
effects plugins via LADSPA, LV2, or VST.

## Work Breakdown

## Current Progress

This feature has been attempted twice by two GSoC students. There is a
lot of old code lying around, and we will try to reuse whenever
possible. The current branch for work on this feature is the
[lp:\~mixxxdevelopers/mixxx/features\_effects](https://code.launchpad.net/~mixxxdevelopers/mixxx/features_effects)
branch.
