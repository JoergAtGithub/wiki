The mixxx engine has quite a long history and it shows it's limitations.
A more modern language like rust looks like a better candidate for the next generation engine.
This page is for collecting ideas, wishes and musthaves for a engine rewrite.

# Wishes
[ ] Using rust feasable ?
[ ] Stems support
[ ] Isolation against crashes of QT gui ? (seperate process ?)
[ ] better scratching engine ?
[ ] Multiprocess

# Must-Haves
[ ] Lock free architecture

# Ideas
[ ] seperation of lv2 plugins in processes like bitwig ?
[ ] parts of code in faust ?
