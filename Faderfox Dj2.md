The mapping matches the labeled controls so that using the controller
should be straightforward. However, the following points might need a
few explanations :

  - The green *FX ctrl* buttons work like this : the left green button
    on Channel 1 enables fx unit 1 on Channel 1, the right green button
    on channel 1 enables fx unit 2 on Channel 1, shift + left green
    button enables fx unit 3 on Channel 1, and so on.
  - The *Kill* button controls Low Kill and *Shift + Kill* controls High
    Kill.
  - To load a track, set the top encoder to *List/Load* position by
    pushing the top black button in the encoder section. Turn the
    encoder to select the track. Then push the encoder to load the
    track. The encoder will switch to the *Seek/Scratch* position,
    acting as a jog.
  - Sync can be enabled by pushing the top encoder while in
    *Seek/Scratch* position.
