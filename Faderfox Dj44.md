## Description

Fully midi compliant controller, industrial style, built by hand in
Hamburg, Germany by Mathias FuchÃŸ. Compact style for mobile DJ-ing, the
controller comes in its own carrying case. No jog wheels, scratching
(kind of) and strip search can be done via encoders. The crossfader also
is not initially built for scratching, as it runs pretty tight and
slower (but precise). Default values for Deck, FX slots and global
controls can be changed, so one can use two DJ44 devices side by side
for 4 decks.

## Mapping

Every control is sending a midi note, so the basic mapping is easy.
Javascript is needed for Loop section, scratching via encoders and
perhaps for some LED.

### Progress

v0.5: Basic mapping for Mixxx 2.0. is done via xml for essential
functions and LED. Looping display does not work so far, changing loop
size works via Shift+Button at the moment (encoder unused) and effects
sections need more attention. Quick Filter button and LED is unused at
the moment. Javascript mapping is needed for more comfort.

### Overview (what's working?)

Graphical overview comes later, let's say, in v1?

#### Transport

  - Play/Pause with LED (static or blinking)
  - Cue (Shift+Play)
  - Fast play forward/backward (grey buttons)
  - Nudging forward/backward (dark grey buttons) - but not progressive
  - Pitch up/down, Pitch reset (encoder push)
  - Key reset (at any Pitch rate, Shift plus encoder push)
  - Hotcues 1 to 8 (clear with Shift)
  - Sync button and LED (Shift unused so far)
  - Seek encoders (push unused, should be scratching later --\>
    Javascript)

#### Mixing

  - Crossfader
  - Line fader
  - Prelisten buttons and LED

#### Master

  - Master volume
  - Headphones volume
  - Headphone mix

#### Equalizer

  - Deck Gain
  - High, Mid and Low EQ
  - Kill low and mid EQ with LED (Shift = mid)
  - **unused:** Pan knob

#### Effects, filters

  - Quick filter knob
  - **unused:** button and LED for Quick filter (possibly: LED for
    effect loaded?)

#### Looping

  - Loop in and out
  - Double and halve loop lengt (Shift plus in/out)
  - Start/Stop loop with LED (static or blinking)
  - Move loop forward/backward via Shift + dark gray transport buttons
  - **unused:** Loop encoder, loop encoder push, Shift + loop encoder
    push, loop display --\> Javascript)
