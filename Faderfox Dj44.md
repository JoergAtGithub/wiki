## Description

Fully midi compliant controller, industrial style, built by hand in
Hamburg, Germany by Mathias Fuch√ü. Compact style for mobile DJ-ing, the
controller comes in its own carrying case. No jog wheels, scratching
(kind of) and strip search can be done via encoders. The crossfader also
is not initially built for scratching, as it runs pretty tight and
slower (but precise). Default values for Deck, FX slots and global
controls can be changed, so one can use two DJ44 devices side by side
for 4 decks.

## Mapping

Every control is sending a midi note, so the basic mapping is easy.
Javascript is needed for Loop section, scratching via encoders and
perhaps for some LED.

### Files

  - Basic mapping, xml only - with continious play and loop LED
  - Essential functions work. Improvements neede for looping (LED,
    encoder instead of shift+buttons) and FX section.
