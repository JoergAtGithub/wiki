If you think of a feature that we need to implement at some time, jot it
down here so you don't forget.

  - Split cue/master headphone support
  - Visual 'track ending' indicator for visual waveform
  - Effects panel integration with UI
  - Looping controls
  - 'Online' BPM detection so that visual waveform beat marks can
    actually be accurate.
