If you think of a feature that we need to implement at some time, jot it
down here so you don't forget.

Some of these are copied over from the forums and the old wiki, so they
may be done already or irrelevant.

  - Split cue/master headphone support
  - Visual 'track ending' indicator for visual waveform
  - Effects panel integration with UI
  - SVG/Vector based skins so hitting fullscreen can automatically
    resize the widgets.
  - Looping controls
  - 'Online' BPM detection so that visual waveform beat marks can
    actually be accurate.
  - M4A support
  - hotkey support (maybe configurable?)
  - adjustable drag sensitivity on visual waveform view
  - direct outs (table 1, table 2, master, headphones)
  - [Effect plugins](PluginIdeas)
  - live input (switchable input at first, maybe a delay/pitchable input
    later)
  - OSC controlled backend [Details from Old
    Wiki](http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/OSC_Backend)
  - some more physically modelled turntable styles, with concepts of
    inertia, slipmat vector, and motor drive. [Details from Old
    Wiki](http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Deck_Remodeling)
