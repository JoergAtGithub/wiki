# Google Code-in

[Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) is an annual contest
that introduces pre-university students ages 13 to 17 to the world of
open source development. With a wide variety of bite-sized tasks, itâ€™s
easy for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they
have.

Tasks can be divided into the following categories:

  - Code: Tasks related to writing or refactoring code
  - Documentation/Training: Tasks related to creating/editing documents
    and helping others learn more
  - Outreach/Research: Tasks related to community management,
    outreach/marketing, or studying problems and recommending solutions
  - Quality Assurance: Tasks related to testing and ensuring code is of
    high quality
  - Design: Tasks related to user experience research or user interface
    design and interaction

We're considering joining this effort in partnership with [The
MetaBrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/) for the mutual benefits
it would provide: sharing of Mixxx users' careful metadata with the
wider community (with opt-in) and time savings when Mixxx users add new
tracks to their databases that already exists in the MetaBrainz
databases.
