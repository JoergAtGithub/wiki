## Mapping Description

Most of the board's controls work as described in the G4V's manual, with
a few exceptions.

### Mixer

  - In the middle of board, there are HIGH, MID, and LOW EQ, GAIN, and
    FILTER knobs for the individual virtual decks that work as normal
  - The Master and Cue Mix knobs works as normal, with Cue Mix mapped to
    Pre/Main
  - The Booth knobs affects the internal sound card

### Deck Select Buttons

  - Just below the Tempo slider on either side of the board is a Deck
    Sel button (1|3 on the left and 2|4 on the right). These buttons
    toggle the controls on the board between the virtual decks.
  - When the button is lit up, the first deck (1 on the left or 2 on the
    right) is the active virtual deck
  - When the button is flashing, the second deck (3 on the left or 4 on
    the right) is the active virtual deck
