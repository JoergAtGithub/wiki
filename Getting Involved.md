## Getting Involved with Mixxx

You want to make Mixxx better, but what can you do?

## Code it\!

The most direct way to help Mixxx is through coding. Patches that fix
bugs are welcomed with open arms. Mixxx is written in C++ and makes
extensive use of the [Qt](http://qt.io/) libraries, which make C++ more
like Java than C.  
If you have some programming experience but don't know C++, working on
Mixxx can be a great way to start learning C++. Take a look at the
[Learning Resources](Learning%20Resources) page. If you do not already
use one, it is a lot easier to work on a huge C++ program like Mixxx
with an IDE such as KDevelop or Eclipse than a text editor such as Kate
or GEdit.

Have a look at the [Developer
Documentation](home#developer_documentation) part in the wiki for
compiling and guidelines. See [Using Git](Using%20Git) for how to get
your changes included in Mixxx.

The best way to get familiar with the code base is to tackle some of the
[easy bugs that can be fixed in a
weekend](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx?field.tag=easy+weekend&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED).
There are also lots of [wishlist
bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx?field.tag=easy+weekend&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.importance%3Alist=WISHLIST).
These are things that people have requested be added to Mixxx.
Completing any of these will make someone's day (or a lot of people's
year, depending on the bug)\!

**So you're somewhat technical but not a C++ coder, what else can you
do?**

## Test it\!

Grab the latest development builds from [our build
server](http://downloads.mixxx.org/builds/master/release/) or [compile
the source code from git](home#compile%20mixxx%20from%20source%20code).
Suggest improvements and [report bugs](reporting%20bugs).

You can also provide feedback on experimental features before they are
merged into the master git branch by [checking out GitHub pull requests
locally](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247).

## Tune it\!

You can publish your tricks for tuning Mixxx to the max on whatever
combination operating system/hardware you run onto the
[Wiki](http://mixxx.org/wiki/); new users often struggle with a getting
good low-latency set-up so easy to follow tuning instructions are an
invaluable contribution.

## Tweak it\!

With a little knowledge JavaScript, you can [modify the hardware
controller script files](midi_scripting) to do crazy-new-awesome things
or just fix up a function that is already there. If you have access to
hardware that is not listed as having a Mixxx mapping in the [DJ
Hardware Guide](hardware%20compatibility), mappings for new devices are
appreciated\! Refer to the [Contributing
Mappings](Contributing%20Mappings) page for more details.

## Skin it\!

Are you good at graphics design? Help make Mixxx look even better by
doing some artwork or skinning the interface.

Make a skin, check out this page for how to [Creating
Skins](Creating%20Skins).

Make some promo artwork - eg. T-Shirt designs, DJ artwork for the
website, etc, and post them to our mixxx-devel mailing list or on our
forums.

Keep the work original please (ripping off other people's copyrights
ain't cool and it can get us in trouble).

## Teach it\!

If you already know you are a kick-ass DJ, please show us your awesome
skills and teach us a thing or two about how to use Mixxx to DJ better
by doing a video and putting it up on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mixxx) or
[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/search?q=mixxx).

Mixxx is looking for a resident DJ to teach the rest of us. ;)

If you know of helpful resources for DJing, please add them to the
[Beginner DJ Links](Beginner%20DJ%20Links) wiki page. You can also help
by contributing to [the manual](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual).

If you are fluent and literate in languages other than English, you can
[help translate Mixxx](internationalization).

## Show it\!

If you love Mixxx, show it... Record a mash-up and [post
it](http://soundcloud.com/). Show Mixxx off in a club. Show Mixxx to
your friends.... take Mixxx on a world tour. We'll provide the Mixxx
stickers. :D

Then show us what you did on [IRC](irc://freenode.net/#mixxx), the
[forums](http://mixxx.org/forums/), or the [mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel).

## Support it\!

Not technical? No time to spare? No worries, making a monetary donation
only takes about 2 minutes. You can donate without a Paypal account
using just a credit card. Please see the Donate button on our [main
homepage](http://mixxx.org/).

We also accept hardware donations from manufacturers of DJ equipment
which we use to improve both specific and general hardware support in
Mixxx. Please contact [the hardware coordinators](hardware@mixxx.org) if
you'd like to work with us.
