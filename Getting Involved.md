## Getting Involved with Mixxx

You want to make Mixxx better, but what can you do?

\<cue Daft Punk synths\>

*Code it\! Tune it\!*

*Tweak it\! Skin it\!*

*Teach it\! Test it\!*

*Show it\! Support it\!*

*Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\!*

## Code it\!

The most direct way to help Mixxx is through coding - patches that fix
bugs are welcomed with open arms (attach them to a [LP bug
report](http://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx) or send them to the [mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel)). Mixxx
is written in C++ and makes extensive use of the
[Qt](http://www.qtsoftware.com/) libraries, which make C++ a lot more
like Java than C.

Minor feature enhancements can be sent to the [mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel).

Bigger changes can be done by [creating a
branch](http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/using_bazaar#general_procedure_for_distributed_use)
on [Launchpad](https://code.launchpad.net/mixxx) and then proposing a
merge when the changes reach a stable state.

The best way to get familiar with the code base is to tackle some of the
[easy bugs that can be fixed in a
weekend](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bugs?field.searchtext=easy&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch=&field.has_no_package=).

And here's a [list of wishlist
bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&field.importance%3Alist=WISHLIST&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.tag=&field.tags_combinator=ANY&field.has_cve.used=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.affects_me.used=&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_branches.used=&field.has_branches=on&field.has_no_branches.used=&field.has_no_branc).
These are things that people have requested be added to Mixxx.
Completing any of these will make someone's day (or alot of people's
year, depending on the bug\!)

**So you're somewhat technical but not a C++ coder, what else can you
do?**

## Tune it\!

You can publish your tricks for tuning Mixxx to the max on whatever
combination operating system/hardware you run onto the
[Wiki](http://mixxx.org/wiki/); new users often struggle with a getting
good low-latency set-up so easy to follow tuning instructions are an
invaluable contribution.

## Tweak it\!

With a little knowledge JavaScript, you can [modify the hardware
controller script files](midi_scripting) in the midi folder (remember to
send patches to the
[list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel)) do
crazy-new-awesome things or just fix up a function that is already
there.

## Skin it\!

Are you good at graphics design? Help make Mixxx look even better by
doing some artwork or skinning the interface.

Make a skin, check out this page for how to [Creating
Skins](Creating%20Skins).

Make some promo artwork - eg. T-Shirt designs, DJ artwork for the
website, etc, and post them to our mixxx-devel mailing list or on our
forums.

Keep the work original please (ripping off other people's copyrights
ain't cool and it can get us in trouble).

## Teach it\!

If you already know you are a kick-ass DJ, please show us your awesome
skills and teach us a thing or two about how to use Mixxx to DJ better
by doing a video and putting it up on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mixxx) or
[Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/videos/search:mixxx).

Mixxx is looking for a resident DJ to teach the rest of us. ;)

## Test it\!

Grab the latest feature builds (looping, library) from our build server
and try them out, suggest subtle improvements, figure out a method to
crash them and then [report bugs and suggestions onto
launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx).

[How to download and compile development
version.](How%20to%20download%20and%20compile%20development%20version.)

## Show it\!

If you love Mixxx, show it... Record a mash-up and [post
it](http://soundcloud.com/). Show Mixxx off in a club. Show Mixxx to
your friends.... take Mixxx on a world tour. We'll provide the Mixxx
stickers. :D

Then show us what you did on [IRC](irc://freenode.net/#mixxx), the
[forums](http://mixxx.org/forums/), or the [mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel).

## Support it\!

Not technical? No time to spare? No worries, making a monetary donation
only takes about 2 minutes. You can donate without a Paypal account
using just a credit card. Please see the Donate button on our [main
homepage](http://mixxx.org/).

We also accept hardware donations from manufacturers of DJ equipment
which we use to improve both specific and general hardware support in
Mixxx. Please contact [Adam Davison](adamd@mixxx.org) if you'd like to
work with us.
