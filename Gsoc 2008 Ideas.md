# Google Summer of Code 2008

[Google's Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) program provides
funding for students who'd like to contribute to open source projects.
Mixxx is a good project to work on because it gives you experience
working with cross-platform development as well as writing code that's
going to power live performances (ie. stability is key).

# Ideas

We're currently compiling a list of ideas for potential projects from
our developers. The ideas list "is meant to introduce contributors to
your project's needs and to provide inspiration to would-be student
applicants".

## Your idea here

(With thorough description)

  - Scalable Vector based UI
  - Use SVG graphics, scale them, copy the way KDE games do scaling.
  - MixxxCharts
  - Collect playback stats from willing users into a DB; generate chart
    web pages by Genre, Promo tracks, and New tracks

## Adam's (no longer) Mental Notes

Not all of these may still seem like good ideas for projects in the cold
light of day...

  - More detailed MIDI controller support
  - All this state machine transformations stuff done properly... will
    write this into a real project asap
  - Rewrite the waveform display\!
  - Get LADSPA stuff finished and into GUI, don't really want to offer
    effects again...
  - Make it easier to develop skins
  - Auto-testing, crash-proofing etc etc can come around again although
    we didn't accept anyone for it last time
  - Something to do with auto-learning midi controllers or creating
    configs through some fancy UI or something
  - Support for mobile devices, ipods and phones and mass storage in
    general
  - Sampler\!
  - Kittens\!

# Have a better idea?

We're all ears\! Please outline your ideas in detail in your student
application to GSoC 2008, as per [Google's
outline](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_student_app).
