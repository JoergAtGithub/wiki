# Google Summer of Code 2008

[Google's Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) program provides
funding for students who'd like to contribute to open source projects.
Mixxx is a good project to work on because it gives you experience
working with cross-platform development as well as writing code that's
going to power live performances (ie. stability is key).

# Ideas

We're currently compiling a list of ideas for potential projects from
our developers. The ideas list "is meant to introduce contributors to
your project's needs and to provide inspiration to would-be student
applicants".

## Your idea here

(With thorough description)

  - Scalable Vector based UI
  - Use SVG graphics, scale them, copy the way KDE games do scaling.
  - MixxxCharts
  - Collect playback stats from willing users into a DB; generate chart
    web pages by Genre, Promo tracks, and New tracks

# Have a better idea?

We're all ears\! Please outline your ideas in detail in your student
application to GSoC 2008, as per [Google's
outline](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_student_app).
