### 2015

Mixxx applied as a mentor organization for [Google Summer of
Code, 2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015?PageSpeed=noscript)
but was declined this year in order to make room for newer organizations
(like [Icecast](http://icecast.org/)\!)

To all the students who were interested, you don't have to get involved
with Mixxx through GSoC\! If you'd like we can work with you to scope
out a project and get your work in the hands of DJs worldwide. Working
on Mixxx (and open source in general) is a great learning experience and
also looks good on a resume.
