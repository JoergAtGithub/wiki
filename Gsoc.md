## Past Years

### 2019

Mixxx applied as a mentor organization for [Google Summer of
Code, 2019](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2019?PageSpeed=noscript)
but was declined this year in order to make room for newer organizations

To all the students who were interested, you don't have to get involved
with Mixxx through GSoC\! If you'd like we can work with you to scope
out a project and get your work in the hands of DJs worldwide. Working
on Mixxx (and open source in general) is a great learning experience and
also looks good on a resume.
