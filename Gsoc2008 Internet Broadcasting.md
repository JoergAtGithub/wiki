# Internet Broadcasting (GSoC 2008 project)

### Abstract

Implementing Shoutcast, Icecast and Icecast2 integration will allow
users to broadcast their mix in real-time over the world wide web on any
platform. At the moment this is only possible on Linux by using JACK
(Jack Audio Connection Kit), but this has a lot of limitations. By
implementing this functionality into Mixxx itself it will make tighter
integration between Shoutcast/Icecast and Mixxx possible. Think about
features like advanced metadata tagging or multiple streams. Whatâ€™s more
important is that this will make it possible for users to broadcast
their mix over the internet on any platform supported by Mixxx. An MP3
and Ogg Vorbis encoder will have to be written for this project as well.
Metadata for the tracks will be sent separately for MP3 tracks or merged
into the Ogg-container for Ogg Vorbis-tracks.
