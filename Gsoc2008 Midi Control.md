# Implementing an improved MIDI control system into the Mixxx project (GSoC 2008 project)

  - Student: **Thomas Lachlan Care**

### Abstract

I am an undergraduate Software Engineer who believes he can contribute
significantly to the Mixxx project on both a short term and long term
basis. I aim to implement a combination of major and minor features, as
well as paving the way to implement features beyond the Google SOC 2008.
The main feature I wish to improve is general MIDI support – a task well
suited to me, due to my personal hardware and experience with industry
DJ equipment as a performer. I also plan to implement small features as
a secondary objective, building on the well-designed feature set of
Mixxx. Most of these features come from my experience as a Trance DJ –
e.g. CDJ like interface, general customisability extensions (pitch
increments, for example), and jog dial sensitivity. My lack of
satisfaction with current DJ software and personal desire to experiment
with my hardware will result in me being a long-term contributor to this
project. I am a reliable person who is a pleasure to work with and I
hope I can benefit the project in any way possible.
