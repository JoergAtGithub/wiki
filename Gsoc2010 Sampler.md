# Creating a Sampler for Mixxx (GSoC 2010 Project)

  - Student: **Ryan Baker**
  - Mentor: **Albert Santoni**

### Abstract

For some people, myself included, mixing and DJ'ing is more than just
playing one track after the other at the same speed. For my project, I
will be writing a sampler for Mixxx that will allow users to play hits,
loops, vocals, and other samples on command. This will allow users to
add flair and creativity to their mixes. I believe this will be a major
addition to Mixxx and feel that it is a feature that many users will
appreciate.
