#### Sampler Decks

##### Overview

Mixxx currently has 2 main decks for playing audio tracks. Many DJs like
to incorporate sample tracks into their sets so that they can enhance
their sets by playing extra samples on command. The goal of this project
is to support this workflow by adding multiple samplers into Mixxx.

##### Project Deliverables

  - Implement Mixxx-engine support for multiple samplers
    1.  Model a new Sampler class off of the Player class
    2.  Provide code for other parts of Mixxx (e.g. the GUI widget) to
        control the Sampler 
  - Implement a Sampler GUI widget that displays: 
    1.  The overview waveform of the sample audio (using our
        pre-existing waveform widgets)
    2.  Buttons to play/pause the sample, and a button to enable looping
        of the sample 
    3.  Button to eject the current track from the sampler
