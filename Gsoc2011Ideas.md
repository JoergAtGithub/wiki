# Student Project Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2011

## Plug and Play MIDI Mode / Community MIDI Mappings

### Overview

Mixxx currently supports a wide-range of hardware MIDI controllers that
DJs can use to perform with. Each supported MIDI controller has a
"mapping" file that is bundled with Mixxx, but this mapping must be
manually selected by the user before their controller works. The aim of
this project is to increase the usability for new users by automatically
selecting the correct MIDI mapping and to provide an intelligent
workflow for when an unsupported MIDI device is connected.

This project will involve a lot of time thinking about use cases,
dealing with users and understanding their requirements. It would be a
great opportunity for a student to get involved with the Mixxx
community. The student will also have the opportunity to borrow a MIDI
controller from the development team for the duration of the project.

### Project Deliverables

  - Implement auto-selection of MIDI mappings based on connected MIDI
    devices.
  - For unsupported devices, implement a UI and simple server-side
    functionality to:
    1.  Check mixxx.org for additional community-provided mappings.
    2.  Allow ratings and comments to be made on community-provided
        mappings.
    3.  Allow user-created mappings to be uploaded to mixxx.org.

### Overview

As always with Summer of Code, you aren't limited to the suggestions
we've made here. If you've got a great idea for a project involving
Mixxx then we're looking forward to hearing about it.

**IMPORTANT: You should [contact us](gsocadvice) first to get feedback
if you're going to submit a proposal for your own project idea\!**
