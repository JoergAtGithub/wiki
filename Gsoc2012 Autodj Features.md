# Abstract

The main goal of this project is to make AutoDJ sound more like a real
DJ. The main feature that would allow this is beatmatching support in
AutoDJ. Currently, AutoDJ only crossfades between two songs over a
certain time interval, much like iTunes or other media players can do. I
plan to use the power that Mixxx already has, such as BPM sync and beat
detection, to improve the way that AutoDJ handles transitions.
