# Summary

**Status:** This specification is **in drafting**. Please feel free to
edit this page and add your comments. Mixxx currently supports a
wide-range of hardware MIDI controllers that DJs can use to perform
with. Each supported MIDI controller has a “mapping” file that is
bundled with Mixxx, but this mapping must be manually selected by the
user before their controller works.

The aim of this project is to increase the usability for new users by
automatically selecting the correct MIDI mapping and to provide an
intelligent workflow for when an unsupported MIDI device is connected.
And when a mapping for a MIDI device is not present, the user should not
be left out in the cold. She should have the option of connecting to
mixxx.org to see if there are any official or user-contributed mappings
available for download.
