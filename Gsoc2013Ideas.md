# Student Project Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2013

This page lists the suggested projects for students working on Mixxx as
part of [Google Summer of
Code 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013/).
Each of these projects represents something that we think would make a
really big difference to our users and that we as a development team are
really excited about. For advice on how to get in touch and how to
apply, you should read [GSoC Advice](gsocadvice).

**A GSoC application that simply repeats the project description will
NOT be accepted. We expect you to think about the feature and how it
aligns with Mixxx's goals, outline potential use-cases and propose a
plan for implementing a solution.**

## Mixxx Remote

## Cover Arts

## Mixxx as Effect Host

## Library GUI Layout Redesign

## Mixxx Touch

## Advanced Tagging

## Non-Blocking Database Access

## D-Bus Interface

## Pick up or continue a GSoC 2012 project

The Ideas from 2013 can be viewed here: [GSoC 2013 Ideas](gsoc2013ideas)

## Something Else\!

As always with Summer of Code, you aren't limited to the suggestions
we've made here. If you've got a great idea for a project involving
Mixxx then we're looking forward to hearing about it. Our bug tracker is
full of wishlist bugs and other ideas scattered throughout, so if you
browse through it, you may find many more ideas for GSoC projects.

**IMPORTANT: You should [contact us](gsocadvice) first to get feedback
if you're going to submit a proposal for your own project idea\!**
