# Student Project Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2019

This page lists the suggested projects for students working on Mixxx as
part of [Google Summer of
Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Each of these projects
represents something that we think would make a really big difference to
our users and that we as a development team are really excited about. If
you are interested in applying to GSoC, read [GSoC Advice](gsocadvice)
before applying or getting involved.

A GSoC application that simply repeats the project description will
*NOT* be accepted. We expect you to think about the feature and how it
aligns with Mixxx's goals, describe potential use cases and propose a
plan for implementing a solution.
