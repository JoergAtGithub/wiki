# Google Summer of Code Advice

Thank you for your interest in working on Mixxx with Google Summer of
Code\! GSOC can be a fun and rewarding way to put your coding skills to
use by contributing to free software. GSOC students gain valuable
experience not only in programming, but also collaborating with an
international community to make awesome software used by thousands of
people around the world. We welcome you into our community and hope that
you find working on Mixxx as fun as we do\!

This page has some general advice for students thinking about applying
for Summer of Code with Mixxx. If you wish to apply for the program then
you will need to visit [the official Google Summer of Code
website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).

## Getting Involved

We consider more than the words in your application when deciding which
students to accept. We look for signs that you will become an active
participant in our community and hopefully continue to stay involved
after GSOC ends. The best way to show us this is to get involved before
beginning your application. Here are some ways to get started:

  - Read the [Mixxx manual](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/) to get a
    better understanding of what Mixxx can do and what people use it
    for.
  - Introduce yourself on our [Zulip
    chat](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/). Start a new topic in the \#gsoc
    stream.
  - Help users with technical questions about Mixxx on the
    [forum](https://mixxx.org/forums/).
  - Report bugs on our [bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/).
  - Look through the [start\#Developer
    Documentation](start#Developer%20Documentation) and make a small
    code contribution to fix a bug or enhance an existing feature.

## What Project Should I Work On?

GSOC lasts several months, so it is important that you choose a project
that you are personally passionate about that you will be excited to
work on for an extended period. We cannot tell you want you want to work
on, but we have some suggestions for project ideas. In general, your
project proposal can be inspired by any of the following:

  - A project from our [GSoC 2018 Ideas Page](gsoc2018ideas)
  - A project you come up with\! Make sure to contact us **before**
    submitting to get feedback if this is your plan.
  - You can use our [Wishlist
    Bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&field.importance%3Alist=WISHLIST&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.tag=&field.tags_combinator=ANY&field.has_cve.used=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.affects_me.used=&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_branches.used=&field.has_branches=on&field.has_no_branches.used=&field.has_no_branches=on&search=Search)
    page for inspiration for your project.

## What Would Working On Mixxx Be Like?

The Mixxx development environment is cooperative and relatively
informal. Our community is small but unusually diverse. Working on Mixxx
you would have an opportunity to interact with a unique mixture of
programmers, artists and DJs. Mixxx as a piece of software also offers
some unique challenges, we are both cross-platform and (soft) real-time
and support a huge range of MIDI and audio hardware devices. Students
with Mixxx will have an opportunity to learn advanced skills like
low-latency programming and cross-platform application deployment which
will look great on your resum√©.

We also very much value the contributions students make. Because Mixxx
is relatively small, students' work often makes a large impact. During
and after your Summer of Code project you will have the opportunity to
put your work in the hands of real DJs and hear how they've used it.
Past students have had a lot of fun working on Mixxx and learned a lot
at the same time. If you want challenging problems, freedom to develop
your ideas, interesting people and an all-round brilliant Summer, then
apply to work on Mixxx.

## Am I Experienced Enough?

This is a common question asked by prospective students, the answer is
generally: "Yes". You do need some prior experience with C++, even if it
was only for a small school project, but you do not need experience with
the specific libraries or algorithms Mixxx uses.

We value general software design and development experience above
specific knowledge of a library or API. We have found in the past that
an interested and motivated student who is willing to learn is more
valuable than anything else. For example, if you've never used Qt before
but have done lots of Java and Gtk+ UI development then you should make
sure you let us know about it in your application.

Of course if you do have direct experience with the tools we use, you
should definitely tell us about that too. The main external tools we
rely on are Qt, SQLite, and Git.

## Our expectations from students

#### Communication

  - Write a weekly report on your progress
  - This can be delivered via mailing list message, blog post, or email
    to the mentors list.
  - Commit early, commit often, and push to GitHub so that we can see it
  - Actively work on your project plan and communicate with us during
    the community bonding period
  - Communicate every working day with your mentor. Just say "hello" if
    you like. We primarily use [Zulip](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/) and
    comments on [GitHub pull
    requests](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pulls) to communicate.
  - If there are good reasons for not communicating please announce them
    early.
  - If you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

#### Midterm and Final evaluations

  - Set a realistic goal for mid-term. If you fail to meet your own goal
    we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations.
  - Have some code merged into the master Git branch at the end of the
    summer to pass the final evaluation.
  - The later is a hard requirement so make sure that your time plan
    includes it.

## How Do I Write A Great Application?

Firstly, think about your choice of project carefully, you're going to
be doing it for a couple of months, so it's important that you choose
something you're going to enjoy. Once you've made your mind up:

1.  Make sure you've thought about the project and understand what it
    entails
2.  Don't be afraid to come up with original solutions to the problem
3.  Don't be afraid to give us lots of detail about how you would
    approach the project
    1.  Things like UI mockups are very much encouraged where
        appropriate
4.  Consider how much time you need for each part of the project

Overall, your application should make us believe that you are capable of
completing the project and delivering the functionality to our users. If
you aren't sure about anything, get in touch with us, we're happy to
advise you.

#### Splitting up your project into smaller pieces

We require our students to merge some of their code into our master
branch before the end of the summer. The best way to achieve this is to
divide your project into small self contained subprojects and plan to
merge at least one of them around midterm.

A good example for this is 'Improve our track managment':

``` 
 - handle property changes for a selection of tracks
 - add a custom editor for cue points
 - add an editor for the BPM-grid
 - build an editor to comment time slices of a track
```

Another approach is to analyze what the absolute minimal requirements
are and then adding features on top of that. eg 'implement cover art in
mixxx':

``` 
 - handle reading/storing covers in the database and application
 - Show the cover next to the track name in a deck
 - display the covers in the library view
 - add picture flow
```

During your summer you'll encounter bugs in mixxx or find code that can
be refactored to help you implement your ideas. You can also immediately
fix them in the master branch and help us all out. This has several
advantages. All your pull request will only concentrate on specific
features and are much better to review. And you'll also get direct
feedback from other devs and user during the summer.

Since this is a hard requirement we as mentors will also have an eye on
that and check if your proposal incorporates it and also warn you ahead
of time during the summer if we see that you might not make it.
Communicating with us on a regular basis is vital for that though.

#### Having good time estimates

To get a feeling for the code and get some experience with our code you
can go and tackle some of our easy bugs. Look at the code that you want
to change, check if it follows our coding guidelines. Do some research
on the API's you want to use, plan what classes you will add and how
their public API will look. Write down your algorithms in pseudo code.
The better your research is and the better you plan ahead the easier it
will be to judge how long a given task will take. For your time
estimates you should also consider that you can do less stuff during
exams and try to be a bit conservative. If you have never done anything
like GSoC before you will tend to underestimate the time to complete a
task. I know that giving these estimates is not easy and that also
professionals have problems with it. Having a good plan, knowing its
weak and strong points are can help a lot.

We look forward to your application\! :) - The Mixxx Development Team
