# Google Summer of Code Advice

This page has some general advice for people thinking about applying for
Summer of Code with Mixxx. If you wish to apply for the program then you
will need to visit [the official Google Summer of Code
website](http://socghop.appspot.com/).

## What Project Should I Work On?

In general, your project proposal can be inspired by any of the
following:

  - A project from our [GSoC 2013 Ideas Page](gsoc2013ideas)
  - A project you come up with\! Make sure to contact us **before**
    submitting to get feedback if this is your plan.
  - You can use our [Wishlist
    Bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&field.importance%3Alist=WISHLIST&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.tag=&field.tags_combinator=ANY&field.has_cve.used=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.affects_me.used=&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_branches.used=&field.has_branches=on&field.has_no_branches.used=&field.has_no_branches=on&search=Search)
    page for inspiration for your project.
  - Projects from our past GSoC ideas pages: 
  - [GSoC 2012](gsoc2012ideas)

## How Do I Contact Mixxx?

You are more than welcome to contact us before submitting your
application, we will be happy to advise on most aspects of the process.
Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to
apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions
from the [ideas page](gsoc2013ideas).

So if you'd like to discuss your application, your ideas or just
introduce yourself, then feel free to get in touch in one of the
following ways:

1.  Send an email to our public developers' mailing list:
    [mixxx-devel](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel)
2.  Contact our GSoC administrators directly via email: 
    1.  RJ Ryan (rryan -A-T- mixxx.org)
    2.  Albert Santoni (alberts -A-T- mixxx.org)
3.  Hop on our IRC channel (\#mixxx on Freenode) and see if our mentors
    are around (bkgood, asantoni, rryan). 
    1.  We encourage idling in our IRC channel to get acquainted with
        the wider Mixxx community as well.

## What Would Working On Mixxx Be Like?

The Mixxx development environment is cooperative and relatively
informal. Our community is small but unusually diverse. Working on Mixxx
you would have an opportunity to interact with a unique mixture of
programmers, artists and DJs. Mixxx as a piece of software also offers
some unique challenges, we are both cross-platform and (soft) real-time
and support a huge range of MIDI and audio hardware devices. Students
with Mixxx will have an opportunity to learn advanced skills like
low-latency programming and cross-platform application deployment which
will look great on your resum√©.

We also very much value the contributions students make. Because Mixxx
is relatively small, students' work often makes a large impact. During
and after your Summer of Code project you will have the opportunity to
put your work in the hands of real DJs and hear how they've used it.
Past students have had a lot of fun working on Mixxx and learned a lot
at the same time. If you want challenging problems, freedom to develop
your ideas, interesting people and an all-round brilliant Summer, then
apply to work on Mixxx.

## Am I Experienced Enough?

This is a common question asked by prospective students, the answer is
generally: "Yes". The Mixxx Summer of Code team value intelligence and
enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we
use. We have found in the past that an interested and motivated student
who is willing to learn is more valuable than anything else.

We also value general software design and development experience above
specific knowledge of a library or API. For example, if you've never
used Qt before but have done lots of Java and Gtk+ UI development then
you should make sure you let us know about it in your application.

Of course if you do have direct experience with the tools we use, you
should definitely tell us about that too. The main external tools we
rely on are `Qt`, `scons`, `portaudio` and `git`.

## How Do I Write A Great Application?

Firstly, think about your choice of project carefully, you're going to
be doing it for a couple of months, so it's important that you choose
something you're going to enjoy. Once you've made your mind up:

1.  Make sure you've thought about the project and understand what it
    entails
2.  Don't be afraid to come up with original solutions to the problem
3.  Don't be afraid to give us lots of detail about how you would
    approach the project
    1.  Things like UI mockups are very much encouraged where
        appropriate
4.  Consider how much time you need for each part of the project

Overall, your application should make us believe that you are capable of
completing the project and delivering the functionality to our users. If
you aren't sure about anything, get in touch with us, we're happy to
advise you.

Some other (entirely optional) things you might consider doing:

1.  Why not introduce yourself on the mailing list? Even just to say
    hello, your name and what you're applying to work on
2.  If you don't have Mixxx already, download it, play around with it
    for a while, let us know what you like or don't like
3.  For lots of bonus points:
    1.  Check out [the source](using_git) and compile it, play around
        with the code a little
        1.  Be sure to write about what you did in your application
        2.  If you can't get it to compile, it's probably our fault not
            yours, don't be embarrased to ask for help
