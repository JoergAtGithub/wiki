The Hercules DJ Console 4-Mx is a USB MIDI controller with a built in
sound card. It is very similar to the [Hercules DJ Console
RMX](Hercules%20DJ%20Console%20RMX), but with switches for 4 decks

## Audio

The sound card has 4 inputs and 4 outputs (2 stereo in/out). The inputs
are switchable between line-in and phono, and also is possible to select
different line levels (consumer -10dBV, Pro +4dBu and boost +8dBu ), so
you can connect both cd-players and turntables on the inputs.

  - Inputs are RCA.
  - Outputs are RCA or 1/4" TRS balanced.
  - Microphone input is 1/4" TS
  - Headphone jack is 1‚ÅÑ4" (6.35 mm) TRS stereo

### MAC OS / Windows

Drivers for MAC OS X and Windows can be found on [Hercules support
page](http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=263&cid=1).
Same package for both Audio and MIDI. On Windows, the newest drivers
support Windows 10.

### Mapping configuration in Mixxx 2.0

#### Master / Global controls

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Control</th>
<th>Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cross-Fader</td>
<td>Fades between left and right decks</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Vol. Main</td>
<td>Controls the Master volume knob of Mixxx.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Scratch</td>
<td>Toggles scratch mode. When scratch mode is enabled, pressing a jog wheel controls scratching</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Auto</td>
<td>Enable AutoDJ or fade to next song if AutoDJ is already enabled.<br />
In the future this could do autofading in live mode too</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Folders / Files</td>
<td>Switches between browsing the sidebar in the library, or the list.<br />
If Folders is pressed twice, opens/closes the tree branch<br />
If Files is pressed when in AutoDJ mode, the next song in the Auto DJ cue is skipped</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Up / Down</td>
<td>Moves up and down in the library track list.<br />
If held down and a jog wheel is moved, then the jog wheel takes over the cursor movement until the up/down button is released</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cue/Mix</td>
<td>Control mix of master and PFL (cue) output in headphones</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Mic On/Off</td>
<td>Enables or disables the microphone.<br />
This is configured by default to be mixed in hardware. The controller's driver allows to change this to use it as an input channel</td>
</tr>

Note: The Microphone volume and the Headphone volume controls are
hardware controls (i.e. they don't control Mixxx's interface)

#### Deck / Channel specific controls

This button has an additional function in Mixxx. If you keep the button pressed while pressing another of the fx buttons, it will trigger the shift-pressed action described for that button</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Keypad 1 to 4</td>
<td>Set/Unset a beatloop of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 beats. They act like the corresponding buttons in Mixxx.<br />
If Shift-pressed, buttons 1 and 2 use a beatloop size of 0.125 and 0.25, and buttons 3 and 4 act as loop end/reloop button.<br />
When a loop is set that isn't one of these four main cases, buttons 3 and 4 will be lit to indicate a loop is present</td>
