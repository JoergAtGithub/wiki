The Hercules DJ Console 4-Mx is a USB MIDI controller with a built in
sound card. It is very similar to the [Hercules DJ Console
RMX](Hercules%20DJ%20Console%20RMX), but with switches for 4 decks

## Audio

The sound card has 4 inputs and 4 outputs (2 stereo in/out). The inputs
are switchable between line-in and phono, and also is possible to select
different line levels (consumer -10dBV, Pro +4dBu and boost +8dBu ), so
you can connect both cd-players and turntables on the inputs.

  - Inputs are RCA.
  - Outputs are RCA or 1/4" TRS balanced.
  - Microphone input is 1/4" TS
  - Headphone jack is 1‚ÅÑ4" (6.35 mm) TRS stereo

### MAC OS / Windows

Drivers for MAC OS X and Windows can be found on [Hercules support
page](http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=263&cid=1).
Same package for both Audio and MIDI. On Windows, the newest drivers
support Windows 10.
