The Hercules DJ Console 4-Mx is a USB controller with a built in sound card. It is very similar to the [[Hercules DJ Console RMX]], but with switches for 4 decks.

The DJ Console 4-Mx is not a USB class compliant MIDI or audio device. It does not work on Linux. Drivers for Mac OS X and Windows can be found on the [[http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=263&cid=1|Hercules support page]].

=====Audio=====

The sound card has 4 inputs and 4 outputs (2 stereo in/out). The inputs are switchable between line-in and phono, and also is possible to select different line levels (consumer -10dBV, Pro +4dBu and boost +8dBu ), so you can connect both CD players and turntables on the inputs.
  * Inputs are RCA.
  * Outputs are RCA or 1/4" TRS balanced.
  * Microphone input is 1/4" TS
  * Headphone jack is 1/4" (6.35 mm) TRS stereo

======Mapping ======
A mapping existed in Mixxx 1.11 which does not work correctly.

Functions marked as (2.1) are implemented in a new mapping released the 26th of September of 2016 (further updated on november 2016 plus some corrections on january 2017).

===== Hercules Tray Icon configuration ====

The drivers for Windows and OS X install an application that can be used to configure the audio and controller settings. Most of the settings work well on the default setting.

  * ** Volume/Pan/Mute **: Sets the volume output for channels 1-2 and channels 3-4. Note that the volume of the channels 3-4 refers to the line output from behind. In other words. It does not affect the volume of the headphones.
  * ** Line in mode **: Sets the line level of the inputs. In case of line 1-2, it also allows to redirect the microphone to the line 1-2. Else, it is mixed in hardware to the master out.
  * ** Talkover attenuation **: Sets how much to attenuate the master output when activating the hardware mixed headphones.
  * ** Enable/Disable jog wheels **: Allows to disable the jog wheels, in case the user desires not to use them.
  * ** Sensitivity **: Alters the sensitivity of the jog wheels. If you change this, change also the sensitivity option in the script, as described below.
  * ** Audio Mode **: Enables the WDM drivers (non-asio) or the specific ASIO-only driver.
  * ** MIDI pitch resolution **: Sets the resolution of the pitch sliders. Mixxx will work with any of the two settings, but it is recommended to set it to 14bit (8bit used) which doubles the precision versus 7bit.
  * ** ASIO **: You can configure the samplerate, bit depth and latency for the ASIO driver.
  * ** MIDI channel for controls **: //Keep these at 1-2 (Default) when you use it with Mixxx.//
  * ** Crossfader settings **: Allows to configure how does the crossfader react. Mixxx also offers an alternate invert option in the crossfader settings.
  * ** Headphone channels **: Allows to setup which input channels are sent to the headphone output.
  * ** Channels 1-2 hardware mix **: Allows mixing the line in or the headphone directly in hardware to the speaker output.
  * ** Deck mode **: //Leave this at 4 Decks (Default) if you want to use four decks with Mixxx. Else, you will only be able to use two decks.//


===== Options =====
There are several options that can be configured for this mapping. You can edit these by opening the Hercules-DJ-Console-4-Mx-scripts.js file in your [[controller mapping file locations#user controller mapping folder]] in a text editor like Notepad, TextEdit, or gEdit and editing the values at the top of the file.

  * **autoHeadMix**: Indicates if the Headphone/Master mix should automatically be set to master when none of the headphone cue buttons are activated.
  * **autoHeadcueOnLoad**: Automatically enable the headphone cue select (PFL) of the deck when a song is loaded. (Like in virtual-dj)
  * **beatFlashLed**: set which LED, if any, blinks with the beat
  * **useVuMeters**: Simulate vuMeters using the kill and source buttons' LEDs. If enabled, shows master VUs, or deck VU depending if prefader listen button is enabled or not.
  * **naviScrollSpeed**: KeyRepeat speed for navigating up/down, in milliseconds. 100 is a good value. Lower values make it scroll faster.
  * **crossfaderScratchCurve**: The controller has two modes to report the crossfader position. The default/beatmix curve, and the scratch curve. The default curve reports the real position of the control. The scratch curve just crossfades on the edges. Setting this setting to true, the curve will change to scratch curve when the scratch mode is on (scratch button). Setting it to false will not change it, so it will use the setting configured in the DJHercules Tray-icon configuration.
  * **vinylSpeed**: Playback speed of the virtual vinyl that is being scratched. 45.00 and 33.33 are the common speeeds. (Lower number equals faster scratch)
  * **sensitivity**: Jog wheel sensitivity. You should configure this setting to the same value than in the DJHercules tray icon configuration. (Normal means 1/1). If crossfaderScratchCurve is true, or the setting is changed while Mixxx is active, this value will be detected automatically.
  * **alpha**: alpha value for the scratch filter (start with 1/8 (0.125) and tune from there)
  * **beta**: beta value for the scratch filter (start with alpha/32 and tune from there)
  * **FXbuttonsSetup**: This indicates which mapping for the FX buttons should Mixxx use. The possible values are: mixxx21, mixxx20, and original (Hercules Manual and the default setup in Virtual DJ 7 LE)

^ Cross-Fader      | | Fades between left and right decks |
^ Vol. Main        | | Controls the Master volume knob of Mixxx.                                                                       |
^ Scratch          | | Toggles scratch mode. When scratch mode is enabled, pressing a jog wheel controls scratching                    |
^ Auto             | | Enable AutoDJ. \\ Stop decks 1 and 2 to disable it using the controller. |
^ Auto             | AutoDJ on | Fade to next song.       |
^ Folders / Files  | | Switches between browsing the sidebar in the library, or the list. \\ If Folders is pressed twice, opens/closes the tree branch |
^ Files  | AutoDJ on | The next song in the Auto DJ cue is skipped  |
^ Up / Down        | | Moves up and down in the library track list. \\ If held down and any of the jog wheels is moved, then the jog wheel takes over the cursor movement until the up/down button is released                                            |
^ Cue/Mix          | | Control mix of master and PFL (cue) output in headphones                                                        |
^ Mic On/Off       | | Enables or disables the microphone. \\ The  microphone is always mixed in hardware. The trayicon driver configuration allows to choose between direct mixing, or mix it only when enabled with the button. \\(2.1) It no longer tries to activate Mixxx microphone talkover.        |

Note: The Microphone volume and the Headphone volume controls are hardware controls (i.e. they don't control Mixxx's interface)

^ Sync                | Beatgrid edit mode    | (2.1) When the track is stopped, aligns the beatgrid with the current playback position. If playing, synchronizes the beatgrid to align with that of the other playing track.  |

^ Cue Select Deck    |            | Toggles on and off this deck's output to the monitor/prefader listen (headphones)  \\ By default, it is configured in the JavaScript to activate it automatically when a new track is loaded in the deck.   |
