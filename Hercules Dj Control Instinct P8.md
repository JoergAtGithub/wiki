## Setup

The controller is a class compliant MIDI controller

### Audio Channels

There are two outputs on the controller itself: the headphones output
with builtin volume control on the side facing you and the speakers
output.

In Mixxx the headphones output is on channels 3 and 4, so select the
"Channels 3-4" item to get stereo output. The speakers output is on
channels 1 and 2, so to get stereo output you want to select the
"Channels 1-2" item.

Some further comments:

  - Hercules uses shifted controls for decks C and D. However, not all
    functions may be mapped for the additional decks and the
    soft-takeover did not work well despite adding all the affected
    controls to the JavaScript code. Thus I have commented out the
    corresponding mappings.
  - The FX mode mappings deviate from Hercules documentation as
    scripting would be required.
  - The pitch reset was reassigned to Shift + Sync because the jog touch
    detection is rather sensitive and would reset inadvertently.
  - Neither normal nor scratch mode react to the wheel when a touch is
    detected. (todo)
  - After scratching the sound remains somewhat distorted until
    disabling scratch mode. (reason unknown)
  - Virtual knobs respond rather slowly to turning of the encoder knobs.
