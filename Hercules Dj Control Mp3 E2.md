# Hercules DJ Control MP3 e2

[[/media/16445_.jpg|]]

The Hercules DJ Control MP3 e2 is a USB MIDI controller without a built
in sound card. It is compatible with Mixxx versions 1.8+ herc and later.
It works in Linux 32/64 bits (from kernel \~2.6.27+), Windows (XP,
Vista, 7), and MAC OS X (10.4.11 (Tiger)/ 10.5.x (Leopard)/ 10.6.x (Snow
Leopard) 32-bit)

## MIDI driver

The midi device on the MP3 e2 is NOT USB-midi class compliant. For that
reason it requires specific drivers to be working on each OS.

### MAC OS / Windows

Drivers for MAC OS X and Windows can be found on [Hercules support
page](http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=215&cid=1).

### Linux

Hercules has released a common MIDI-driver for their DJ controllers.
Read more on the page for \[\[Hercules Linux kernel module\]

## Mapping for Mixxx

The Hercules MP3 e2 mapping for Mixxx is integrated in Mixxx so you
don't have to download or install nothing.
