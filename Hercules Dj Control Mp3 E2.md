{{ :16445_.jpg?nolink& |}}



The Hercules DJ Control MP3 e2 is a USB MIDI controller without a built in sound card. It is compatible with Mixxx versions 1.8+ herc and later. It works in Linux 32/64 bits (from kernel ~2.6.27+), Windows (XP, Vista, 7), and MAC OS X (10.4.11 (Tiger)/ 10.5.x (Leopard)/ 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) 32-bit)

=====MIDI driver=====

The midi device on the MP3 e2 is NOT USB-midi class compliant. For that reason it requires specific drivers to be working on each OS.

====MAC OS / Windows====

Drivers for MAC OS X and Windows can be found on [[http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=215&cid=1|Hercules support page]].

====Linux====
Hercules has released a common MIDI-driver for their DJ controllers. Read more on the page for [[Hercules Linux kernel module]

===== Mapping for Mixxx =====
The Hercules MP3 e2 mapping for Mixxx is integrated in Mixxx so you don't have to download or install nothing.
