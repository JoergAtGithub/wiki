Ultra-compact, ultra-light, ultra-practical and ultra-unique with its
lights, the DJControl Starlight packs all the features needed to mix and
scratch. With its built-in audio interface, the DJControl Starlight
offers pre-listening in the headphones so you can then play your mix on
speakers, which is perfect for learning or creating new mixes. The
system is so comprehensive for its size that it boasts all the essential
features such as bass equalization/filter knobs for smooth transitions
or touch-sensitive jog wheels for easy scratching. The added bonus: the
bright and powerful RGB backlighting.
