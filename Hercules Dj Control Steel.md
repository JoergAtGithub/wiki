# Hercules DJ Control Steel (page under construction)

[[/media/hardware/hercules_dj_control_steel.jpg|]]

The Hercules DJ Control Steel is a USB MIDI controller (very similar to
DJ Console RMX but without a built in sound card). It is compatible with
Mixxx versions 1.6.1+herc and later. It works in Linux 32/64 bits (from
kernel \~2.6.27+), Windows (XP, Vista, 7), and MAC OS X (10.4.11
(Tiger)/ 10.5.x (Leopard)/ 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) 32-bit)

## MIDI driver

The midi device on the Steel is NOT USB-midi class compliant. For that
reason it requires specific drivers to be working on each OS.

### MAC OS / Windows

Drivers for MAC OS X and Windows can be found on [Hercules support
page](http://ts.hercules.com/eng/index.php?pg=view_files&gid=17&fid=62&pid=215&cid=1).

### Linux

Hercules has released a common MIDI-driver for their DJ controllers.

module](Hercules%20Linux%20kernel%20module)

## Mapping for Mixxx

You need to update the mapping with following files : [Link to mapping
