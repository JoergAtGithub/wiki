## Compatibility

This controller is a class compliant USB MIDI and audio device, so it
can be used without any special drivers on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows. However, if you wish to use the [ASIO sound
API](http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/configuration.html#audio-api)
under Windows, please install the latest driver package available from
the [Support
page](https://support.hercules.com/en/product/djcontrolinpulse300-en//).

## Sound card setup

This controller has built-in 4 channel output sound card, with MASTER
output (RCA and 3.5mm jack) and HEADPHONE output (6.35mm and 3.5mm
jack).

\* Open **Preferences \> Sound Hardware**  
\* Select the **Output** tab  
\* From the **Master** drop-down menu, select the audio interface, then
**Channels 1-2**  
\* From the **Headphones** drop-down menu, select the audio interface,
then **Channels 3-4**  
\* Click **Apply** to save the changes.  

Please refer to the user manual for more details about the[audio
configuration in
Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/example_setups.html#laptop-and-external-usb-audio-interface)
and [learning how to set your levels
properly](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html#djing-gain-staging).

### Mapping description

Save both MIDI and script files to your [controller mapping file
locations\#user controller mapping
folder](controller%20mapping%20file%20locations#user%20controller%20mapping%20folder),
then load the preset as described in [the user
manual](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/controlling_mixxx.html#using-midi-hid-controllers)

NOTE: As it is not being used in the mapping , I'd recommend disabling
the Proximity sensor (**AIR control**) in the DJControl AIR+ control
panel in order to prevent unnecessary MIDI data being sent to Mixxx
