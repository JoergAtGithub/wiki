# Hercules Linux kernel module

Hercules released a linux driver for the MIDI part of their DJ consoles
and controllers. Since it's been outdated by newer kernel versions,
community members are now maintaining it, so it works also in newer
kernel versions.

For Ubuntu 10.04 and up, you'll want lightrush's patched version
