with software such as Mixxx.

Currently, there are 5 different models:

  - Hercules DJ Console MK2 - Very popular controller with a built in
    4x4 soundcard. (Two inputs, two outputs.) 
  - Hercules DJ Console MK1 - Same as the MK2, but much older.
  - Hercules DJ Control MP3 - Very similar to the MK2, but without the
    built-in soundcard. It's also significantly cheaper.
  - Hercules DJ Console Mac Edition - Same as the MK2, slightly
    different MIDI mapping file in Mixxx.
  - Hercules DJ Console RMX - Next-generation Hercules controller,
    release date is April 2008. Will be supported in Mixxx if we can get
    our hands on one.

Mixxx's support for the Hercules controllers is described on our
[hardware compatibility](hardware_compatibility) page.
