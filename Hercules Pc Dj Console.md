The Hercules PC DJ Consoles are a series of USB DJ controllers for use
with software such as Mixxx.

Currently, there are 5 models:

  - Hercules DJ Console MK2 - Very popular controller with a built in
    4x4 soundcard. (Two inputs, two outputs.) 
  - Hercules DJ Console MK1 - Same as the MK2, but much older.
  - Hercules DJ Control MP3 - Very similar to the MK2, but without the
    built-in soundcard. It's also significantly cheaper.
  - Hercules DJ Console Mac Edition - Same as the MK2, slightly
    different MIDI mapping file in Mixxx.
  - Hercules DJ Console RMX - Next-generation Hercules controller,
    release date is April 2008. Will be supported in Mixxx if we can get
    our hands on one.
