## Compatibility

This controller is a class compliant USB MIDI and audio device, so it
can be used without any special drivers on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows. 
However, if you wish to use the [ASIO sound
API](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/preferences.html?highlight=asio#windows)
under Windows, please install the latest driver package available from
the [Support
page](https://support.hercules.com/en/product/djcontrolinpulse500-en//).

## Sound card setup

This controller has built-in 4 channel output sound card, with MASTER
output (RCA) and HEADPHONE output (3.5mm jack).

\* Open **Preferences \> Sound Hardware**  
\* Select the **Output** tab  
\* From the **Master** drop-down menu, select the audio interface, then
**Channels 1-2**  
\* From the **Headphones** drop-down menu, select the audio interface,
then **Channels 3-4**  
\* Click **Apply** to save the changes.  

Please refer to [the user
manual](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/example_setups.html#laptop-and-external-usb-audio-interface)
for more details about the audio configuration in Mixxx as well as to [learn how to set your levels properly when using Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html#djing-gain-staging)

### Mapping description

***
Save both MIDI and script files to your [user controller mapping
folder](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/controller%20mapping%20file%20locations#user%20controller%20mapping%20folder),
then load the preset as described in [the user
manual](https://mixxx.org/manual/latest/en/chapters/controlling_mixxx.html#using-midi-hid-controllers)

#### Please note:
The following are hardware controls and interact directly with the integrated soundcard's input and output. 

##### Master 
- Master Vol
- Master Headphone button
##### Headphones
- Headphone mix knob
- Headphone Volume
##### Mic
- Mic Vol
- High
- Low
##### Aux
- Aux Vol
- Aux Filter

Although they also send MIDI messages, they have NOT been mapped in Mixxx, so do not expect an on-screen reaction when using them.
This was done to prevent the knobs to adjust both the parameters on the controller's sound card and in Mixxx.

##### Other controls not included in this mapping:

* PADS mode 5-8

* Filter/FX buttons
