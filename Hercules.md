## Intro

Welcome the Mixxx page for Hercules devices, Mixxx is the world's best
open source DJ software and the only one that runs on Windows, Mac OSX
and Linux... Hercules does not directly develop or support
troubleshooting of Mixxx, so please direct questions/bugs
encountered/comments/praise about Mixxx to the [Mixxx community
sites](#mixxx-community-sites) at the top of this page.

The purpose of this page is to document how controls have been mapped to
different or non-obvious functions in Mixxx, controls not listed here
should behave as you would expect (i.e. Crossfader cross fades, Play -
plays/pauses, etc). These mappings work with Hercules MIDI drivers for
Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. *Untested* mappings are based on MIDI code
documentation in the Hercules manuals and have not yet been extensively
validated by the Mixxx community.

Brackets indicated control position on diagrams to the Left. Diagrams
are copyright of Hercules/Guillemot corporation.
