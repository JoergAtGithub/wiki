# Welcome to the new Mixxx Wiki\!

Mixxx has an unusually broad community for an open-source project,
encompassing performing musicians, C++ addicts, amateur DJs and even
just casual users. The Mixxx Wiki contains useful information for users,
developers, and artists, and is summarized in the categories below.

Most of the old MediaWiki installation is moved off of SourceForge and
into our new wiki. For the remaining page, the [Mediawiki-to-Dokuwiki
online markup
converter](http://johbuc6.coconia.net/mediawiki2dokuwiki.php) will
continue to be useful.
