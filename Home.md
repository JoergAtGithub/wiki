# Welcome to the Mixxx Wiki\!

Mixxx has an unusually broad community for an open-source project,
encompassing performing musicians, C++ addicts, amateur DJs, Internet
radio broadcasters, and casual users. The Mixxx Wiki contains useful
information for users, developers, and artists, and is summarized in the
categories below.

Some pages have translations available. You can read them by clicking
the language icon at the bottom of a page.

Most of the contents of this wiki can be edited by anyone, the main
exception to this is the [development roadmap](development%20roadmap)
which is a fairly authoritative description of the development team's
plans. If you find outdated, incorrect, or incomplete information on
this wiki, please fix it.

  - [Development
    builds](http://downloads.mixxx.org/builds/master/release): Please
    help us test the latest code and report bugs. We try to make sure
    code is reasonably stable before including it in these, but only use
    development builds if you are comfortable using bleeding edge
    software. Do not upgrade to a new version without adequate time to
    test it before a performance.
