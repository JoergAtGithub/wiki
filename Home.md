# Welcome to the Mixxx Wiki\!

Mixxx has an unusually broad community for an open-source project,
encompassing performing musicians, C++ addicts, amateur DJs and casual
users. The Mixxx Wiki contains useful information for users, developers,
and artists, and is summarized in the categories below.

Most of the contents of this wiki can be edited by anyone, the main
exception to this is the [development\_roadmap](development_roadmap)
which is a fairly authoritative description of the development team's
plans.
