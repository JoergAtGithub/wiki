<span class="underline">**The Money Room’s Top 10 ‘Back to Basic’Tips to
Getting Debt Free\!**</span>

*Managing Director Andrew McBay shares ten basic, yet powerful tips to
get you on the path to financial freedom.*

Buy now, pay later\! We’ve all fallen for the alluring call of credit
card companies at one point or another. But what they don’t tell you is
that it’s actually buy now, pay LOADS MORE later... With tough economic
times these past years, more and more people have been turning to credit
cards to make ends meet. Figures from the Reserve Bank show that
Australians have 15.4 million credit cards in their wallets, on which
they’re paying interest on $36 billion in outstanding balances. More
than two-thirds of consumers’ debt is accruing interest at the average
rate of nearly 20%. Think about this... that means if you have $4,000 in
credit card debt, you’re wasting $800 every year paying off interest. In
5 years time, that’s $3,000 down the drain\! This is why eliminating
your debt is so important. That’s easier said than done. Getting rid of
debt can be confusing and scary process. Sometimes, it can feel like
you’ll never be free. That’s why we have put together a few tips to
get you started. For more advanced tactics on getting rid of debt, visit
our blog at <http://themoneyroom.com.au/blog/>.

**The Money Room Tip \#1: Don’t Ignore
It**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span> This may sound
obvious, but the majority of those in debt delay getting the assistance
they need for months or even years. Unfortunately, the debt won’t
disappear – it will GROW (as will your stress).

**The Money Room Tip \#2: Get
Organised**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

Almost half of Australians don't know the interest rate they pay on
their credit cardsor home loan. You can’t eliminate your debt
effectively if you don’t have basic information like this at hand. So,
empower yourself by getting it.Write down what type of debts you have,
for example, establish whether they are secured, such as a mortgage, or
unsecured, such as personal bank loans or credit cards. Make a list of
the balances, minimum payments due, annual fees and interest rates for
each. Having gotten the best financing to start with is ideal. If you
are unsure how to get the RIGHT financial products for your situation,

The Money Room Tip \#3: Notify Creditors & Know Your
Rights**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

If you are experiencing repayment difficulties,contact your creditors as
soon as possible to let them know your situation and work out a
repayment plan. They may be able to freeze interest or arrange for
smaller monthly payments. It’s important to know your rights when
dealing with creditors. Learn about them here
<http://transition.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/799403Believe>
it or not, lenders want to work with clients in distress. They don’t
want to make matters worse as they want their money back.

**The Money Room Tip \#4: Draw Up a
Budget**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

First find out your Disposable Income (DI), which is the amount of money
you have left after deducting from your income all your reasonable and
necessary ~~~~Strike-through Text~~~~living expenditure. Next, look for
areas where you might be overspending, so you can cut back and maximise
the amount you put towards your debt.A base consideration of The Money
Room is to establish what the smile on your face costs, do you know?

**The Money Room Tip \#5: Stop
Saving**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

Many people try to save at the same time that they’re paying off debt.
This is a big mistake. The amount of interest earned in savings is small
compared to the rate at which loans' interest rates rack up. So, stop
saving and start paying.As long as you have debt you shouldn’t have
savings.

**The Money Room Tip \#6: Prioritise Debt
Repayments**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

It’s important to figure out which payments are your priorities. For
example, missing payments on secured debt, like a mortgage, is much more
serious because failing to keep up payments could result in you losing
your home. Also, you should focus first on your
highest-interest,short-term debts as those are costing you the most and
stripping cash-flow.Atargeted approach is required to achieve effective
results.

**The Money Room Tip \#7: Consider
Consolidation**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

Consolidation may make your monthly payments more manageable. Instead of
keeping up with eight payments, you can reduce it to one or two.
Additionally, if you can get a deal on a lower interest rate, you’ll
save loads of money in the long run.

**The Money Room Tip \#8: Take Into Account All
Options**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

Look at other funding sources to help you pay off debt, like other
savings accounts or investments. As long as your outgoing interest on
your debt is higher than the interest you earn on those savings and
investments, your money is better put towards getting rid of that debt.
Also, for those in serious debt, bankruptcy is a viable option that
should be discussed with a financial advisor. You are taxed on savings
income, however, you are not taxed on the interest you don’t pay\!

**The Money Room Tip \#9: Seek Advice &
Support**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

There are a lot of options out there and an experienced financial
advisoror money coach can help you navigate them to get you debt free as
QUICKLY and EASILY as possible. With the amount of money you could be
saving, it is a worthwhile investment. Get in touch to speak with one of
The Money Room’s specialists today

people and influences.

**The Money Room Tip \#10: Stay Positive& Don’t Give
Up**<span class="underline">Underlined Text</span>

It’s easy to get discouraged, but remind yourself that by taking
proactive steps, you’re getting closer to getting out of the red every
day. Look to friends, family and advisors for support and encouragement.
The feeling of financial freedom will be worth it\!

Remember, money is money; you have enough or you don’t. The real
ingredient in understanding money is to understand the psychology of it
and how that interacts with your life. I hope you found these tips
helpful. At The Money Room, we’re passionate about helping people build
financially secure futures. Contact us with any questions – we’re always
