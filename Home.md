Introduction to Ayurvedic medicine

Ayurvedic medicine is a system of Hindu traditional medicine of Vedic
tradition, is native to the Indian subcontinent, and is a form of
alternative medicine. Origins of Ayurveda have been traced back to 5,000
BCE, originating as an oral tradition and later as medical texts,
Ayurveda evolved from the Vedas. Ayurveda is a discipline of the upaveda
or auxiliary knowledge in Vedic tradition. It is treated as a supplement
or appendix of the Rigveda. However, some believed that Atharva-Veda is
the prime origin of Ayurveda. There are three major principles in
Ayurveda, these are the Charaka Samhitha -Treatise on Medicine, Susrutha
Samhitha - Treatise on Surgery and Ashtanga Samgraha - Treatise on the
basic principles. The samhita of the Atharvaveda itself contains 114
hymns or incantations for the magical cure of diseases. Charak has
advised in his samhita that physicians should adhere to Atharva-Veda.
