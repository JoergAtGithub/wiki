# Welcome to the new Mixxx Wiki\!

We need help moving the old MediaWiki installation off of SourceForge
and into the new wiki on our new server. At the same time, we might as
well cleanup and reorganize the wiki, so we're moving everything over by
hand.

If you'd like to help, here's a running list of the pages that need to
be copy-and-pasted over into the new wiki:

## User Documentation

  - [Hardware Compatibility](Hardware%20Compatibility)
  - [FAQ](FAQ)
  - [Tutorials](Tutorials)

<!-- end list -->

``` 
* 
```

## Developer Documentation

  - [Compiling on Linux](Compiling%20on%20Linux)
  - [Compiling on Windows](Compiling%20on%20Windows)
  - [Compiling on OS X](Compiling%20on%20OS%20X)
  - [Submitting Patches](Submitting%20Patches)
  - [Coding Guidelines](Coding%20Guidelines)
  - [Feature Discussion](Feature%20Discussion)
  - [UI/MIDI Controls and Names](UI/MIDI%20Controls%20and%20Names)
