**3 Reasons Why Investing in Real Estate Is Easier Than Ever**

**1. Start conservatively.**

The first and most important aspect to remember when
[<span class="underline">investing</span>](https://www.lntrealty.com) is
preserving money. “Market growth is slowing down,” explains Schoffler.
“When you’ve worked hard to save money you can finally invest, you
need to be careful to not just invest it anywhere. I recommend starting
out by investing with a more conservative approach because I’ve done it
the other way and lost.” “If you adopt the investment concept of
compounding -- the process of increasing your return based on reinvested
earnings -- you might be surprised what you could earn over time. But
you need to be comfortable playing the long, rather than short game.
Make sure your investments will perform well in both an up and down
economy.”

**2. Don't worry about diversification -- just start**.

A lot of people (including myself) are so worried about investing
intelligently and maintaining diversification that they never begin
investing. Schoffler suggests, however, “If the minimum buy-in is $5,000
for an investment you understand and really want to get into, don’t wait
until you have $100,000 built up to participate. If you are fairly
conservative with your early investments, you can earn while you learn.”

**3. Technology is changing the game and inviting new players.**

Before the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, it was illegal for
unaccredited investors to invest in non-traded REIT offerings. The only
options were the stock market and possibly a fixer upper if you were
willing to endure the hassle of being a landlord.

“However,” explains Schoffler, “since this legislation went into effect,
and with the proliferation of fintech \[financial technology\] that
enabled investment firms to serve more investors at lower costs, there
are more opportunities to invest in professionally run, institutional
quality real estate. And as a result, now large established investment
firms such as BlackRock, Carlisle Group and others are launching online
investment platforms, some with extremely low minimums.”

“Compared to traditional private offerings, they are also required to
file a great deal more information, sharing it publicly through the
SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval . This can
help investors in their due diligence, process. The additional annual
filings requirements also allow investors to keep better track of their
investments, which gives investors way more information about these
non-traded REITs.” Information, technology and transparency are removing
the intimidating shroud that has historically covered the real estate
investment market -- making that leap from saver to investor that much
easier for the future generations of millionaires.
