# Welcome to the new Mixxx Wiki\!

We need help moving the old MediaWiki installation off of SourceForge
and into the new wiki on our new server. At the same time, we might as
well cleanup and reorganize the wiki, so we're moving everything over by
hand.

If you'd like to help, here's a running list of the pages that need to
be copy-and-pasted over into the new wiki:

## User Pages

## Developer Pages

## More Resources

  - Discussions on the
    [mixxx-devel](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel)
    mailing list are the basis for much of the content here.
  - The main [Mixxx website](http://www.mixxx.org).
  - Our [Launchpad project page](http://www.launchpad.net/mixxx/) and
    [bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/).
  - The IRC Channel: \#mixxx on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).
