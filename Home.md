"In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of
night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding"

Good Holy Quran does speak about the desert some of it imagery describes
the desert but it also speak about sea, stars, life and mountains. The
Quran is the last exposed word of Allah and the standard source of
Islamic teachings and laws. The Quran works with the most basic of
creeds, morality, and history of humanity, praise, knowledge, wisdom,
God-man marriage, and human relationship in all respects. Comprehensive
coaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice,
economics, national politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and
international relations, are essential items of the Quran. Hadith,
sayings and actions of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH), thoroughly reported and
collected by his devoted companions. Described and elaborated the
Quranic verses.

The interesting frame of mind that exists in Quran repeatedly deals with
their advice to the audience. The Quran informs the reader about
different facts and then gives them advice. Quran is the miracles of
Prophecies, Dialect, Style and Scientific Facts. The Holy Qur'an is not
only a Magic. It is a Wonder Performer. It brought away the Miracle of
altering an extremely ignorant and backward society into the guardians
of knowledge and learning. If you need to know more about this or that
or if you doubt what is said then you should ask those who have
knowledge. This is an amazing attitude.

It is not necessarily usual to have a book covered in some one without
training in geography, biology etc who discuss this subject and then
recommend the reader to ask men of knowledge if he doubts anything.
However in every age there has been Muslims who have followed the advice
of the Quran and made surprising discovery. In the event that one looks
the task of Muslim scientists of numerous hundreds of years ago, one
will discover them packed with quotations from the Quran. Their work
explained that they had done research in such places, looking for some
thing. <http://www.holyquranclasses.com/> Learn Quran Online\]
