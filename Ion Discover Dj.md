The ION Discover DJ is a cheap budget MIDI controller meant to "discover
DJ-ing" for people with a potential interest. It does not have a built
in sound card, so a [splitter
cable](hardware%20compatibility#splitter%20cables) or [separate sound
card](hardware%20compatibility#USB%20sound%20cards) would be required to
use headphones with it.

### Compatibility

This controller is USB MIDI class compliant and plug-and-play on all
platforms. The manufacturer's page only mentions Windows and Mac but
it's confirmed working on Linux as well.

### Library browsing

The controls for library browsing are in the center of the controller.

| Control             | Function                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rotary knob         | Track selection                                                                           |
| Load buttons        | Loads currently highlighted track to the corresponding deck (only if no audio is playing) |
| Pushing rotary knob | Loads currently highlighted track to the first deck that isn't playing audio              |

### Jog wheels

The button in the center can be used to switch the jog wheels between
search and scratch mode. In search mode, the jog wheels can be used to
seek to different parts of a song when paused. When that deck is
playing, the jog wheels can be pushed/pulled to speed up/slow down the
playback. This is useful for beatmatching.

Pressing the center button will put the jog wheels in scratch mode,
which means that the deck in Mixxx will follow the absolute movement of
the jog wheels. In this mode the Scratch button is lit.

### Equalizer

This controller only has a 2-band equalizer but Mixxx uses a 3-band EQ.
Therefore, the volume knob has been mapped to the low EQ, the bass knob
has been mapped to the mid EQ, and the treble knob has been mapped to
the high EQ. For volume control between the decks, use the crossfader.

### Other buttons

The pitch buttons will control the tempo which also controls the pitch,
except when keylock is on (padlock icon on screen).

| Button     | Function                                                           | Light                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Sync       | Matches the BPM of that deck to the song playing in the other deck | Blinks according to the beatgrid |
| Rev        | While held the deck plays in reverse                               | only lights when pressed         |
| CUE        | Attached to the cue control in mixxx                               | follows cue button on screen     |
| play/pause | Play/pause the deck                                                | follows play button on screen    |

The behavior of the cue and play buttons can be configured [in Mixxx's
preferences](http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/user_interface.html#interface-cue-modes).
