The ION Discover DJ is a cheap budget midi-controller meant to "discover
DJ-ing" for people with a potential interest.

### Drivers

This controller is MIDI compliant and plug-and-play on all platforms.
The manufacturer's page only mentions windows and mac but it's confirmed
working on linux as well.

### Library browsing

The controls for library browsing are in the center of the controller.

| Control             | Function                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rotary knob         | Track selection                                                                           |
| Load buttons        | Loads currently highlighted track to the corresponding deck (only if no audio is playing) |
| Pushing rotary knob | Loads currently highlighted track to the first deck that isn't playing audio              |

### Switching between search and scratch mode

The button in the center can be used to switch between search and
scratch mode. in search mode the turntables can be used to seek a
particular section of a song when paused. When that deck is playing the
turntables can be pushed/pulled to speed up/slow down the playback. this
is useful for beatmatching. Pressing the center button will put the
turntables in scratch mode which means that the deck in mixxx will
follow the absolute movement of the turntables. In this mode the button
is lit.

### Equalizer

This controller only has a 2-band equalizer where mixxx uses a 3-band
one. Therefore the volume knob has been mapped to the low-EQ, the
bass-knob has been mapped to the mid-eq and the treble-knob has been
mapped to the high-eq. For volume control between the decks, use the
cross-fader.

### other buttons

The pitch buttons will control the tempo which also controls the pitch,
except when the pitch is locked (padlock icon)

| Button     | Function                                                           | Light                                                                                        |

| Rev        | while held the deck plays in reverse                               | only lights when pressed                                                                     |
| CUE        | Attached to the cue control in mixxx                               | lights when the playback cursor is on the cue mark, otherwise blinks when the deck is paused |
