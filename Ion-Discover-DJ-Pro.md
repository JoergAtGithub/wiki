Ion Discover DJ Pro is a 2-deck controller with integrated audio interface and iPhone dock.

The basic operation for this controller is working:
  * play / pause / reverse
  * cue to headphone
  * crossfader
  * deck volume control
  * sync & pitch control
  * scratching
  * sound control bass, mid & treble

But this controller mapping is definitely not "perfect" an might need some more rework for other more advanced features to get working. Please discuss issues and questions on the forum and provide enhancements to this controller mapping via Github.
