Novation no longer have a dedicated page for the controller but drivers,
manuals and MIDI reference guide can be found by search the Twitch

\=======Audio Setup=======

Configure Channels 1 & 2 for Master output and 3 & 4 for the Headphone
Cue. The top right section are analogue hardware controls for the
onboard audio interface and do not affect the related controls within
Mixxx. Note that the Headphone Mix knob has fully anti-clockwise for
Master and fully clockwise for Cue, the reverse of most DJ mixers.

VU Meters have been configured to display Master if no PFL is selected
and to display the Channel selected on the side which has PFL On
(including paging for Decks C/D.) As all LEDs are red the meter has been
calibration so if the top LED is lit then your signal will be running
into clipping. It's best to keep is so the very top LED remains unlit.

\=======Mixxx Mapping=======

The above shows the controller as per the manufacturers website with the
Serato layout printed on the hardware. This is based on what in the MIDI
mapping literature is referred to as Advanced Mode. With the controller
came an overlay for the supplied Traktor based on the Basic Mode MIDI
mapping, which has hardware buttons for deck layers which coincide with
the Shift keys on the Serato layer and thus using the labels as per the
Serato layout is really not applicable if programming in Basic Mode.

[[/media/twitchbasicoverlay.jpg|]]

This is a photo of the overlay for the Traktor/Basic Mode the Mixxx
mapping has been based from.

Throughout this guide I will display the button labels as on the Traktor
overlay first with the labels on the hardware unit displayed in ()
parenthesis so it is clear for users of both.

## Known Issues

None of the Init codes in the manual either remembered or reset the FX
Params paging, thus if the mapping is (re)loaded while Mixxx is in
operation and it's not set on the default (no LED lit) page then it will
not display as controlling the FX page it's on until a button has been
selected. This shouldn't be noticed in normal operation.

## User Options

These can be found at the very top of the mappings .js file.

**fxOnUnitMaster** Set to 0 for FX On buttons to globally turn On/Off
effect 1-4 Set to 1 for FX On buttons to assign Master to effects 1-4.
DEFAULT is 1 as this is how the GUIs have been designed. (No included
GUI has on screen indication of if an FX is enabled but the LEDs work
and you may find this more useful than assigning to master, plus it's
useful to be able to turn them On/Off no matter which page for the Pads
you currently have activate.)

## Master Section

These are hardware controls, see the above Audio Setup section

## Browse Section

With both the Encoder Pressed and SHIFT held down together navigation
will be much faster (over 100 tracks per tick.)  
Rotation is velocity sensitive, the faster you rotate the further you
will move.

## Deck Controls

**DECK A/B C/D (SHIFT)**  
Hardware control buttons to switch layer controls by left or right side
of deck for controlling of 4 decks.

**SYNC (SET/CLR)**  
Press to Sync to playing deck  
Hold to enable Master Sync

**SHIFT (ADJUST/SLIP)**  
SHIFT button (hold to activate any functions listed with SHIFT on this
page.

**TEMPO (PITCH) Encoder**  
Rotate to adjust the playback rate of deck (clockwise = faster whichever
way the faders are set.)  
Press + Rotate to adjust playback rate in larger steps.  
SHIFT + Press to reset playback rate to 0% offset.

**\< BACK (KEYLOCK)**  
Press to toggle Keylock  
SHIFT + Press to Reset Key to original

**FWD \> (SYNC/AUTO)**

Shift + Press to toggle Reverse Playback.

**SWIPE & DROP**  
Hardware controls for the Touchstrip. See below

**TOUCHSTRIP**  
SWIPE active: When Paused shuttle through track. When in Play Jog the
playback pitch to adjust timing.  
DROP active: (Reverts to SWIPE after single operation.) Press or drag on
touchstrip to position the play cursor in relative position in track.  
HOT CUE BANK button + TOUCHSTRIP: Scratch Mode activation. Playback will
resume once HOT CUE Select Button is released (as long as it's from the
same Deck.)  
SHIFT + TOUCHSTRIP: Scratch Mode activation. Subtle difference in that
track will come to stop if SHIFT is released before motion finishes (if
performing EG a SpinBack.) Touch TOUCHSTRIP again to release Scratch and
have full control again. Using a HOT CUE BANK button from the opposite
deck will have similar behaviour.

## Effects Section

The FX PARAMS Buttons controller hardware level switching for layer of
the knobs. With FX1 to FX4 selected it works almost as the [Standard
Effects
Mapping](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/standard_effects_mapping)
minus the ability to control individual controls within an effect. The
fourth button, which would enable this, currently expands/collapses the
view of that effect. (TODO is to bring these controls fully to the
standard.)

With FX layer 0 selected (no LEDs lit.) FX On buttons select the effect
to Master with an configurable option to instead globally Enable/Disable
the effect chain. The knobs control the 4 Super controls in normal mode
and control the 4 Wet/Dry Mix controls when used with SHIFT.
