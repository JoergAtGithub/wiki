## Audio Setup

Configure Channels 1 & 2 for Master output and 3 & 4 for the Headphone
Cue. The top right section are analogue hardware controls for the
onboard audio interface and do not affect the related controls within
Mixxx.

VU Meters have been configured to display Master if no PFL is selected
and to display the Channel selected on the side which has PFL On
(including paging for Decks C/D.) As all LEDs are red the meter has been
calibration so if the top LED is lit then your signal will be running
into clipping. It's best to keep is so the very top LED remains unlit.

## Mixxx Mapping

The above shows the controller as per the manufacturers website with the
Serato layout printed on the hardware. This is based on what in the MIDI
mapping literature is referred to as Advanced Mode. With the controller
came an overlay for the supplied Traktor based on the Basic Mode MIDI
mapping, which has hardware buttons for deck layers which coincide with
the Shift keys on the Serato layer and thus using the labels as per the
Serato layout is really not applicable if programming in Basic Mode.

mapping has been based from.
