# Setting up KDevelop to work on Mixxx

[KDevelop](http://kdevelop.org/) is an integrated development
environment (IDE) that makes working on a large C++ project like Mixxx
much easier than a text editor. This wiki page will help you set up
KDevelop 5 to work on Mixxx 2.1.

First, before running KDevelop, [compile Mixxx](compiling%20on%20linux).
This is important because there are header files generated by the Qt
build process and Protobuf that are \#included by the .cpp files in
Mixxx's src directory. If KDevelop can't find those, it won't be able to
parse the structure of Mixxx.

In KDevelop, go to Project \> Open/import project. Select the directory
where the Mixxx source code is (not the "src" directory, the one above
that; the root of the git repository). Press Next and select Custom
BuildSystem in the Project manager dropdown. On the left side of
KDevelop, click Projects. Right click on your project and select Open
Configuration. Select Language Support on the left of the dialog and
click the Batch edit button to edit the list of \#include paths.
KDevelop normally detects the \#include paths from the build system, but
it is not able to do this with SCons. There are some paths that must be
included in the Mixxx source tree; these must be absolute paths, not
relative to the project root.

Paste this into the Batch edit dialog, replacing /home/be/sw/mixxx with
wherever you have your Mixxx source tree.
