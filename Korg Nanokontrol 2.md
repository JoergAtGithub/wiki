As of Mixxx 2.1, there will be two mappings for this controller included
in Mixxx. The one labeled "Korg Nanokontrol 2 (alternative)" takes
advantage of features introduced in Mixxx 2.0 such as master sync and
cue modes. It was created with the [Mixco mapping
framework](https://sinusoid.es/mixco/) and [documentation for the
mapping](https://sinusoid.es/mixco/script/korg_nanokontrol2.mixco.html)
is on the Mixco website. To use this new mapping with Mixxx 2.0,
download these files and put them in your [controller mapping file
locations\#user controller mapping
folder](controller%20mapping%20file%20locations#user%20controller%20mapping%20folder):
