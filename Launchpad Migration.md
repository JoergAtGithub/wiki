# Problems with Launchpad Bugs

Many people have expressed frustration with [bug tracking on
Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/mixxx). This is a place to enumerate the
problems so we can determine if migrating elsewhere solves them all or
not.

  - Login process is complex: it is a multi step process and the
    platform keeps asking about showing some username
  - No formatting
  - Can't edit comments
  - E-mail notifications are slow
  - Categorization system for issues is inflexible
  - *Give example.*
  - Can't @mention people
  - Posting code and screenshots is clunky
  - *What exactly is wrong? Give an example of what would be good.*
  - Can't make templates for bug reports (e.g. to have people attach
    `mixxx.log` in the initial report)
  - No integration with the code review system (side effect of no longer
    hosting code in LP)
  - Yet another account needed. (Now six total: forum, Freenode, wiki,
    Launchpad, GitHub, mailing list)
