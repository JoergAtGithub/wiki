# Learning resources

This page has some resources to learn background information that may
help you contribute to Mixxx.

## Basics

We recommend you review these sections of the Qt documentation to get
familiar with aspects of Qt that we use heavily:

  - [Signals &
    Slots](http://qt-project.org/doc/latest/signalsandslots.html)

If you're not familiar with C++, [The Cherno
Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb)
on YouTube has a good series dedicated to the core concepts.

As a start, we highly recommend these resources from the Xiph.org
Foundation for background information on digital and analog signal
processing:

  - [A Digital Media Primer For
    Geeks](https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/A_Digital_Media_Primer_For_Geeks)
  - [Digital Show and
    Tell](https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/Digital_Show_and_Tell)
  - [24/192 Music Downloads are Very Silly
    Indeed](https://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html)

## Software Engineering For Realtime Audio

  - [Time Waits For
    Nothing](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing):
    brief introduction to the challenges of writing realtime code (for
    audio or other purposes)
  - [C++ in the Audio
    Industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boPEO2auJj4&index=184&list=PL9gma1TwJCnHxnb_DEmvSyqS4bk7Ik3CZ)
    - one-hour talk from CppCon describing the challenges of audio
    software engineering.
  - [Programming with Lightweight Asynchronous Messages: Some Basic
    Patterns](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/programming-with-lightweight-asynchronous-messages-some-basic-patterns)
    - blog post from Ross Bencina (PortAudio author) about common audio
    signal processing patterns.
  - Real-time 101, a two-hour talk about real-time development. Focuses
    on issues of real-time threads and their communication with the
    outside world. [Part I: Investigating the real-time problem
    space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0vrQFyAdWI&list=PLe2skUvADfhvu_pyet1veIIEAH0LA4iFK&index=3)
    and [Part II: The real-time audio developerâ€™s
    toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZAo2Vikbo&list=PLe2skUvADfhvu_pyet1veIIEAH0LA4iFK&index=12).

## Signal theory

These resources go more in depth about signal processing. Unless you're
writing effects code, you probably don't need to know this much detail
to work on Mixxx.

  - Ethan Winer's book [The Audio
    Expert](http://ethanwiner.com/book.htm) explains everything from
    decibels to digital-to-analog converters to equalizers.
