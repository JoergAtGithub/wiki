# Learning resources

This page has some resources to learn background information that may
help you contribute to Mixxx.

As a start, we highly recommend these resources from the Xiph.org
Foundation for background information on digital and analog signal
processing:

  - [A Digital Media Primer For
    Geeks](https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/A_Digital_Media_Primer_For_Geeks)
  - [Digital Show and
    Tell](https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/Digital_Show_and_Tell)
  - [24/192 Music Downloads are Very Silly
    Indeed](https://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html)

Ethan Winer's book [The Audio Expert](http://ethanwiner.com/book.htm)
explains everything from decibels to digital-to-analog converters to
equalizers.

    Patterns](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/programming-with-lightweight-asynchronous-messages-some-basic-patterns)
    - blog post from Ross Bencina (PortAudio author) about common audio
    signal processing patterns.
  - Real-time 101, a two-hour talk about real-time development. Focuses
    on issues of real-time threads and their communication with the
    outside world. [Part I: Investigating the real-time problem
    space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0vrQFyAdWI&list=PLe2skUvADfhvu_pyet1veIIEAH0LA4iFK&index=3)
