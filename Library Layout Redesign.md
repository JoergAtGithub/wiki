## Summary

This proposal consists of the implementation of a library layout
redesign with tabs for special purpose. The Qt Treeview will be changed
by a vertical layout of buttons allowing more space in many views (from
this point this will be called the LibrarySidebar collapsed version).
Many things are inspired in Clementine player and others are inspired in
the library layout redesign discussion thread
(<https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/986704>). The layout is designed
taking in account the controllers. This will be developed in different
small releases
