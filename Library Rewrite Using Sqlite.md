# Library Rewrite Using SQLite

## Summary and Rationale

**Status**: This specification is **in drafting**. Feel free to add
ideas to this page.

This project is already in progress\! Check it out on launchpad in the
lp:\~mixxxdevelopers/mixxx/features\_sqlite branch.

## Use Cases

  - DJ Bill wants DJ software that has a good library. He's tried Mixxx
    but its library does not scale to his large collection of music. It
    is also buggy, and often gets corrupted so he cannot build up
    quality metadata about his music.
  - **Your use case here**

## Work Breakdown

This [work breakdown
structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) (WBS)
will become more detailed as the design above becomes more thorough and
complete.
