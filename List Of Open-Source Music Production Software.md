# Software list

Here is list of open source software useful in producing music:

  - [Rosegarden](http://www.rosegardenmusic.com) is the equivalent of
    Cubase, Cakewalk, Sonar, Finale … It is also more powerful and
    configurable, and it’s free.
  - [Ardour](http://ardour.org) is a recording studio, very very
    powerful. It is truly extraordinary for audio recording.
  - Audacity is an excellent audio editor, also available for Windows.
    Does not support Jack.
  - [Qtractor](http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/qtractor-index.html) is
    like Ardour. If you like it use it.
  - Bristol is an emulator for all the wonderful sounds of all different
    Moog (and more)
  - Nekobee is a nice emulator for Roland TB-303
  - [Jokosher](http://www.jokosher.org/) is more or less the same thing
    as Audacity, but has nicer interface for gnome, very very
    user-friendly and does not exist for Windows. It seems like Ardour,
    but does not support Jack.
  - [Sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/) is another audio
    editor, not multi-track. It can be convenient because it is very
    simple.
  - [Rezound](http://rezound.sourceforge.net/) is another
    non-multi-track audio editor, simple and colorful. I use it as
    default for editing audio tracks in Rosegarden.
  - [Gmorgan](http://gmorgan.sourceforge.net/) allows you to capture
    audio “live” from an external keyboard while the computer shoots out
    an arrangement with the style you want. Also useful as arranger
    style like Band In a Box.
  - [Qsynth](http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/qsynth-index.html) is a
    program that allows you to take the sounds of instruments and use
    them with effects and volume, turning a sound file of musical
    instruments in a rack module emulated by software. Essentially, it’s
    the same as my Korg. Even if you have a rack module or a cool
    keyboard full of sound, install Qsynth anyway , it is always useful,
    and doesn’t do just that, does a thousand other wonderful things.
  - [Jackd](http://jackaudio.org/) is the heart of everything and is a
    patch bay, that is, a program that shows you all the entries and
    exits of all the programs you have loaded and the sound card that
    you can connect graphically . That is, it’s like a little box that
    connects all the cables from your instrument, with combinations done
    like a mad scientist (Actually by a mad musician): the dream of
    every musician …
  - Qjackctl is a graphical interface to jackd
  - [Hexter](http://dssi.sourceforge.net/hexter.html) is a VST, which is
    the software imitation of a device that produce particular sounds.
    In this case, the perfect imitation of the Yamaha DX7, that mythical
    ’80s keyboard that has become famous for the sound of “The Final
    Countdown” of Europe and “Jump” by Van Halen, but in general it’s
    both cool and absurd having it available because all the music of
    the 80s and early 90s used the sounds of this keyboard.
  - Xsynth-dssi is another VST that will mimic a perfect machine for
    electronic music, just like the old Moog, with hundreds of knobs to
    try out new sounds, and quite a few ‘ready-made’ sound all really
    electronic. There is also a perfect imitator of theremin. A Legend.
  - Flac is a codec (compression/decompression audio), widely used.
    Without installing it Rosegarden will also protest at startup.
  - [Lingot](http://www.nongnu.org/lingot/) is a tuner for your guitar
  - [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/) is a drum machine that,
    in strictly technical terms, kicks ass.
  - Hydrogen-drumkits are drumkit for hydrogen to … i’m sure you guess
    it.
  - Jack-rack allows you to make available some audio plugins. Similar
    to Dssi, but they are available for all applications and not just
    for Rosegarden
  - caps is the king of these plugins (called LADSPA), because it’s the
    one that simulate in real time any kind of amplifier distortion.
    There are really good distortions of the tube, and with a little of
    patience you can get sound from your guitar as if you had a Vox
    AC-30-style Brit-pop or a Marshall metal.
  - [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/home.php) is the Linux equivalent
    of Windows FruitLoops (but is free and open source).
  - fluid-soundfont-gs is a bank of sounds.
  - ZynAddSubFX is a synthesizer that, in highly technical language,
    kicks several asses.
  - [dssi-vst](http://breakfastquay.com/dssi-vst/) is a great plugin
    that allows you to upload several VST Windows
  - [Rakarrack](http://rakarrack.sourceforge.net/) : See Appendix G
  - vocproc is a LV2 plugin, you need it to achieve effects like
    autotune.
  - [zynjacku](http://home.gna.org/zynjacku/) is like Jack Rack but for
    LV2 plugins. You will find it as “Lv2rack”.
