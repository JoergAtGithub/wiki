## Summary

**Status**: This specification is **in drafting**, however active work
will begin immediately and continue through the summer. Please feel free
to leave comments.

DJs often may wish to record loops and samples live from available
output streams, which can then be used again in samplers and the main
decks to play back later. This project aims to implement an easy to use,
but powerful loop recorder for Mixxx, which will give DJs another tool
to be creative in their live mixes.

This project is being undertaken by Carl Pillot for the Google Summer of
Code 2013
