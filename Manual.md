# Introduction

Mixxx is software for DJs that allows you to mix songs live. Mixxx
supports MP3, OGG, FLAC, and WAVE playback, and can be controlled by
numerous DJ MIDI controllers.

# Installation

## Windows

Windows users can install Mixxx by double-clicking on the Mixxx
installer executable. Mixxx is supported on Windows XP and Vista.

## Linux

Linux users can often find Mixxx included with their favourite
distribution. For example, **Ubuntu** users can install Mixxx through
the *Applications-\>Add/Remove...* menu item. If Mixxx is not packaged
for your distribution, you can compile Mixxx from scratch. For details
on compiling Mixxx, see: [Compiling on Linux](Compiling%20on%20Linux)

## OS X

OS X (Intel) users can install Mixxx by double-clicking the Mixxx zip
archive, and then dragging-and-dropping the Mixxx bundle into their
*Applications* folder. Mixxx requires an Intel Mac running OS 10.4+.

# Configuration

The first time Mixxx is started, you are asked to select a directory
containing your music library. This directory will be scanned and any
music found will be indexed in Mixxx's internal library. The music
library path can be changed at any time in the preferences, via the
*Library and Playlists* pane.

Mixxx's preferences can be accessed by selecting
*Options-\>Preferences*.

When Mixxx is launched, it tries to select a reasonable sound device for
output. You can check the settings Mixxx has selected in the *Sound
Hardware* pane in the preferences.
