# Introduction

Mixxx is software for DJs that allows you to mix songs live. Mixxx
supports MP3, OGG, FLAC, and WAVE playback, and can be controlled by
numerous DJ MIDI controllers.

# Installation

## Windows

Windows users can install Mixxx by double-clicking on the Mixxx
installer executable. Mixxx is supported on Windows XP and Vista.

## Linux

Linux users can often find Mixxx included with their favourite
distribution. For example, **Ubuntu** users can install Mixxx through
the *Applications-\>Add/Remove...* menu item. If Mixxx is not packaged
for your distribution, you can compile Mixxx from scratch. For details
on compiling Mixxx, see: [Compiling on Linux](Compiling%20on%20Linux)

## OS X

OS X (Intel) users can install Mixxx by double-clicking the Mixxx zip
archive, and then dragging-and-dropping the Mixxx bundle into their
*Applications* folder. Mixxx requires an Intel Mac running OS 10.4+.

# Configuration

The first time Mixxx is started, you are asked to select a directory
containing your music library. This directory will be scanned and any
music found will be indexed in Mixxx's internal library. The music
library path can be changed at any time in the preferences, via the
*Library and Playlists* pane.

Mixxx's preferences can be accessed by selecting
*Options-\>Preferences*.

When Mixxx is launched, it tries to select a reasonable sound device for
output. You can check the settings Mixxx has selected in the *Sound
Hardware* pane in the preferences.

# DJing with Mixxx

Mixxx was designed to be easy to learn for both novice and experienced
DJs. The user interface mimics a hardware DJ mixer, but also includes
several extra elements to gives DJs a better user experience, such as
the parallel waveform displays.

### Loading tracks

## Waveform displays

There are two main **waveform displays** in Mixxx that are used to
display the waveform of the songs you are mixing. These are useful
because they allow you to see features in a song (like a breakdown)
before you hear them. The waveform displays are aligned parallel to each
other in order to make beat matching easier, as it is possible to
beatmatch visually by aligning the beats that appear in each waveform.
Clicking and dragging on a waveform allows you to seek through a song in
both directions. The waveform display is updated in realtime upon
seeking. There are two smaller **waveform summary** displays located
adjacent to the main waveform displays. These smaller displays show the
waveform envelope of the entire song, and are useful because they allow
DJs to see breakdowns far in advance. Vinyl DJs will find this familiar
because quiet sections of songs can be visually distinguished when
looking at a vinyl record, and this is a useful tool when planning your
mixes on-the-fly.
