# Introduction

Mixxx is software for DJs that allows you to mix songs live. Mixxx
supports MP3, OGG, FLAC, and WAVE playback, and can be controlled by
numerous DJ MIDI controllers.

# Installation

## Windows

Windows users can install Mixxx by double-clicking on the Mixxx
installer executable. Mixxx is supported on Windows XP and Vista.

## Linux

Linux users can often find Mixxx included with their favourite
distribution. For example, **Ubuntu** users can install Mixxx through
the *Applications-\>Add/Remove...* menu item. If Mixxx is not packaged
for your distribution, you can compile Mixxx from scratch. For details
on compiling Mixxx, see: [Compiling on Linux](Compiling%20on%20Linux)

## OS X

OS X (Intel) users can install Mixxx by double-clicking the Mixxx zip
archive, and then dragging-and-dropping the Mixxx bundle into their
*Applications* folder. Mixxx requires an Intel Mac running OS 10.4+.

# Configuration

The first time Mixxx is started, you are asked to select a directory
containing your music library. This directory will be scanned and any
music found will be indexed in Mixxx's internal library. The music
library path can be changed at any time in the preferences, via the
*Library and Playlists* pane.

Mixxx's preferences can be accessed by selecting
*Options-\>Preferences*.

When Mixxx is launched, it tries to select a reasonable sound device for
output. You can check the settings Mixxx has selected in the *Sound
Hardware* pane in the preferences.

# DJing with Mixxx

Mixxx was designed to be easy to learn for both novice and experienced
DJs. The user interface mimics a hardware DJ mixer, but also includes
several extra elements to gives DJs a better user experience, such as
the parallel waveform displays.

## Loading tracks

Songs can be loaded into a player in several ways:

  - Right-click the library track table: Right-clicking on a track in
    the table will present the options "Load in Player 1" and "Load in
    Player 2", among others. Making either selection will load a track
    into a player.
  - Drag-and-drop from library track table: Dragging-and-dropping a song
    from the track table onto a wavefoprm display will load a track into
    a player.
  - Drag-and-drop from external file browser: Dragging-and-dropping a
    song from an external file browser directly onto a waveform display
    in Mixxx will load that song. This function is also known to work on
    some platforms with other applications. For example, on OS X,
    dragging-and-dropping a track from iTunes onto one of Mixxx's
    waveform displays will load that song into a player.

## Waveform displays

There are two main **waveform displays** in Mixxx that are used to
display the waveform of the songs you are mixing. These are useful
because they allow you to see features in a song (like a breakdown)
before you hear them. The waveform displays are aligned parallel to each
other in order to make beat matching easier, as it is possible to
beatmatch visually by aligning the beats that appear in each waveform.
Clicking and dragging on a waveform allows you to seek through a song in
both directions. The waveform display is updated in realtime upon
seeking. There are two smaller **waveform summary** displays located
adjacent to the main waveform displays. These smaller displays show the
waveform envelope of the entire song, and are useful because they allow
DJs to see breakdowns far in advance. Vinyl DJs will find this familiar
because quiet sections of songs can be visually distinguished when
looking at a vinyl record, and this is a useful tool when planning your
mixes on-the-fly.

## Beatmatching and Mixing

**Beatmatching** is the process of adjusting the playback rate of a song
so that it matches the tempo of another song. Beatmatching also involves
adjusting the *phase* of the beats in a song so that they are *aligned*
with the beats in the other song. Matching the tempo and aligning the
beats are the two things a DJ must do to beatmatch. In Mixxx, you can
match the tempo of two songs by adjusting the playback rate sliders on
left and right side of the user interface. You can adjust the phase of
the beats by clicking-and-dragging on either waveform display to
temporarily slow down one of the songs until the beats are aligned. The
temporary pitch bend buttons can also be used to momentarily adjust the
playback rate, allowing you to "shuffle" the beats in a song forwards or
backwards, so they can be aligned with another song. Once the tempos are
matched and the beats aligned between two songs, they are said to be
beatmatched. A "perfect" beatmatch is near impossible - there will
always be some tiny difference in the playback rates. A keen DJ will
keep his or her ears open and listen for the beats drifting out of
alignment. This has a distinct "double bass kick" sound which is often
preceded by the kick weakening in intensity (as the two kicks drift out
of phase). When this happens, the beats can be realigned by simply
tapping one of the temporary pitch bend buttons a few times in the
appropriate direction. Now get out there and make Tiesto jealous\!
