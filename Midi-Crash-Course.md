# MIDI Crash Course

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard for electronic
musical devices to communicate. This page is a brief introduction to
MIDI that should explain what you need to know to [map MIDI controllers
to Mixxx](home#controller%20mapping%20documentation). Refer to [Reverse
Engineering](Reverse%20Engineering) for tips to intercept MIDI data from
a device.

MIDI is a widely used standard that a lot of hardware and software
support. It dates back to the 1980s when it was used to make
synthesizers, samplers, and sequencers communicate. These older devices
used cables with 5-pin DIN connectors to carry MIDI signals. Most MIDI
devices today send the MIDI signals over a USB cable. Some modern
devices can also can use cables with the 5-pin DIN connectors. DJ
controllers with these 5-pin DIN connectors do not ordinarily use them
to send signals to the computer; they are used to communicate via MIDI
with other gear and the ability to use MIDI without being plugged into a
computer (although they need to be plugged into another power source
without a USB cable supplying power).

Controllers that comply with the USB MIDI class standard (also called
"class compliant" devices) do not require any special drivers. Most
controllers are USB MIDI class compliant, but not all. See the [Mixxx DJ
Hardware Guide](hardware%20compatibility) for information about
particular controllers.

Mixxx displays the numbers in MIDI signals in hexadecimal. If you are
unfamiliar with hexadecimal numbers, read [this
tutorial](http://codemastershawn.com/2014/04/03/understanding-binary-and-hex-numbers).

An explanation of the MIDI signals that your controller sends to
computers and how it reacts to MIDI signals that computers send to it
should be available from the controller manufacturer. This is likely in
a document on the product page for your controller on the manufacturer's
website or in the support section of the website. If it is not in a
separate document, it is likely at the end of the manual. Unfortunately,
not every manufacturer provides this information.

## MIDI Messages

Most MIDI messages are three bytes long. The first byte of any MIDI
message is called the **Status** byte. The first nybble (hex digit) is
the op-code and the second is the MIDI channel number. So if you have
`0x90` the op-code is `0x9` and the channel number is `0x0` (Ch 1.) The
full list of MIDI messages is below, where *n* represents the channel
number (0..F inclusive):

| Status     | Function                  | Data bytes         |                   |

| **0x8*n*** | **Note off**              | **Note number**    | **Note velocity** |
| **0x9*n*** | **Note on**               | **Note number**    | **Note velocity** |
| 0xAn       | Polyphonic after-touch    | Note number        | Amount            |
| **0xB*n*** | **Control/mode change**   | **Control number** | **Value**         |
| 0xC*n*     | Program change            | Program number     | (n/a)             |
| 0xD*n*     | Channel after-touch       | Amount             | (n/a)             |

The boldface entries in the table above are the messages we are most
concerned with since most DJ controllers use only these for all
functions. You'll need to consult the MIDI spec for the DJ controller
you're working with to determine which messages and note/control numbers
correspond to the DJ controller functions & LEDs. If your controller's
MIDI spec gives only note names and not numbers, [use this
table](http://www.wavosaur.com/download/midi-note-hex.php) to convert
them. To convert from decimal to hex, [use
this](http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html).

(Note that in order to use System Exclusive messages, you will need
[MIDI Scripting](MIDI%20Scripting).)

## Typical MIDI signals used by DJ controllers

Every controller works differently, but these are some typical patterns.

### Buttons

  - When pressed: Op-code `0x9`, value of `0x7F`
  - When released: Op-code `0x9`, value of `0x00`
  - or Op-code `0x8`, value of `0x00`

### LEDs

If there's a LED behind the button, usually it can be controlled by
sending a message to the controller using the same status and note
number that the controller sends when the button is pressed. As for the
value field, for LEDs that can only be turned on or off, typically
`0x00` turns it off and `0x01` or `0x7F` turns it on. For multi-color
LEDs, the color is typically controlled by sending different values.
Which ones correspond to which colors should be in the MIDI
specification document for your controller. If they are not, you will
have to look at mappings for other DJ software, or just try a few
different values.

### Knobs & sliders

These usually send messages with an op-code of `0xB` and a value
corresponding to the absolute position of the knob or slider (between
`0x00` and `0x7F`

Endless knobs/encoders (that you can turn continuously) typically send
messages with an op-code of `0xB` and the value only indicates whether
the encoder is being turned left or right (`0x01` & `0x7F` or `0x41` &
`0x3F`)

### Jog wheels, touch strips, platters

These usually operate exactly like endless knobs/encoders above, and
they usually also send messages just like buttons above when they're
touched or released which is intended to mark when scratching begins and
ends respectively.
