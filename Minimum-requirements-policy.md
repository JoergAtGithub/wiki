The master branch must build with the packages in the latest Ubuntu LTS which has had at least one point release. New features can be committed to the master branch which depend on packages not yet available in the latest Ubuntu LTS that has had at least one point release, but the master branch must build without the new feature until the first point release of the new Ubuntu LTS.

Major Mixxx releases (X.Y, like 2.2) have the same minimum requirements as the minimum requirements when they are branched from the master branch. Bugfix releases (X.Y.Z, like 2.2.1) will continue supporting the same minimum requirements that the X.Y.0 release did.
