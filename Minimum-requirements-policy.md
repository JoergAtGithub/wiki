Major Mixxx releases (X.Y, like 2.2) must support the packages in the latest Ubuntu LTS at the time of their release. Bugfix releases (X.Y.Z, like 2.2.1) will continue supporting the same minimum requirements that the X.Y.0 release did.

No hacks may be committed for backwards compatibility with dependencies older than this minimum requirements policy.
