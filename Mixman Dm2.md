Important points:

  - You'll need a kernel patch if you're running a kernel before 2.6.24
  - Latest version of his patch (at the time of writing):

## Mixman under Windows

Steps to get it working:

  - You will need both the driver from your original install CD and the
    update from the Mixman website ([WinXP
    update](http://www.mixman.com/products/dm2_updates.html) (won't work
    without this\!))
  - [MIDIYoke](http://www.midiox.com/index.htm?http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm)
    - Download and install MIDIYoke junction.
  - [dm2midi](http://www.pdoom.ch/dm2/) - Then install dm2tomidi ....
    this is the final piece that converts USB output to midi signals
