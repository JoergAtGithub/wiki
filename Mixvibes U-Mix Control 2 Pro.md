IMHO the U-Mix Control Pro 2 offers an unbeatable value for its low
price, which matches most of the professional DJ-Needs. It's a MIDI DJ
controller with an **internal soundcard** and **two Inputs** for
Turntables or any Audio-Source with RCA. This controller is perfect for
DJs seeking a mobile, compact, sturdy DJing solution. It offers also a
**changeable** Cross-fader, **adjustable** Cross-Fader **Curve** and
**individual Touch-Level-Sensors**, which are normally only seen at
triple-priced devices.  
The U-Mix Control **Pro** differs only in Cue-Button-Labels. The U-Mix
Control 2 (without "Pro" = internal soundcard) also. Both should work
fine with this MIDI mapping.
