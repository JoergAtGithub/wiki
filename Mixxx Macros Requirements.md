## Personas

"Raptor" is an experienced DJ who experiments with cue point drumming.

"Bob" wants to prepare his track so he can DJ mostly hands-off at a
birthday party. For this he wants to censor his tracks as well prepare a
few transitions.

"Sona" used to create custom versions of songs (extended & rearranged
parts) in Ableton Live, but would like to avoid the problems this
entails (duplication, quality loss through re-encoding, takes rather
long, can get lost in editing)

"Jannis" wants to record Mash-ups in Mixxx, but currently has to
re-record them several times, and even then he doesn't get them exactly
how he wanted. He doesn't want to get into a DAW for that either.
