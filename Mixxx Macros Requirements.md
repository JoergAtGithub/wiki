## Personas

"Raptor" is an experienced DJ who experiments with cue point drumming.

"Bob" wants to prepare his track so he can DJ mostly hands-off at a
birthday party. For this he wants to censor his tracks as well prepare a
few transitions.

"Sona" used to create custom versions of songs (extended & rearranged
parts) in Ableton Live, but would like to avoid the problems this
entails (duplication, quality loss through re-encoding, takes rather
long, can get lost in editing)

"Jannis" wants to record Mash-ups in Mixxx, but currently has to
re-record them several times, and even then he doesn't get them exactly
how he wanted. He doesn't want to get into a DAW for that either.

## User Stories

As Raptor  
I want to

  - start a Macro recording
  - press cue points to create a beat
  - *if live* have it repeat immediately
  - save this as a looped Macro
  - assign it to a hotcue

so that I have a cool custom beat based on a track, which I can invoke
anytime.  
Requirements: everything on controller

As Bob  
I want to create a very simple rearrangement and censoring of a track
and save it to the track in enabled state  
so that the track is automatically played back in that arrangement.  
Requirements: Without controller

As Sona  
I want to be able to quickly recreate my Ableton Live edits in Mixxx  
so that I can eliminate the data duplication and speed up my workflow
for creating new edits.

As Jannis  
I want to record an edit to a track, potentially with cue point
drumming  
so that I can play that back while creating a Mash-up.  
I would appreciate the ability to edit a Macro so that I don't have to
re-record it if I made a small mistake
