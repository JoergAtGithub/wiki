# Mixxx Macros

*By Janek Fischer (xerus/xerus2000)*

Proposal](/gsoc_2020_proposal_janek_fischer_-_mixxx_macros.pdf)

## Introduction

There are moves through which a DJ expresses himself - and there are
many other, sometimes tedious tasks that need to be done as groundwork.
Instead of having to juggle beatmatching, effects, cues and sliders all
at once, a DJ should be able to rely on his tools so he can focus on
what really matters. For some, beatmatching and keeping all tracks in
sync is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something
happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync
function.  
But sometimes, more sophisticated automation can be helpful - maybe you
want to skip a breakdown, shuffle around verses, loop an intro a
specific way or deliberately repeat certain parts. Handling that while
messing with effects and getting the next track ready can be tricky;
that is where Mixxx Macros come in. With this feature implemented, it
will be possible to record specific moves while playing a track and
store them in a rack, to be used when it gets hot.

## Timeline

CW 21: Establish Timeline, work on open PRs, initial survey &
discussion  
CW 22: Survey existing Serato Flip uses & collect input

### June - Design Phase:

CW 23: Specify the Macro format  
CW 24: Design & integrate into existing skins  
CW 25: *Buffer*  
~~CW 26~~ (blocked)

Deliverable: Format specification

### July - Coding Phase:

CW 27: Implement the data structures  
CW 28: Implement the controls  
CW 29: Create recording infrastructure  
CW 30: Tie it all together

Deliverable: Implemented controls with mapping to a skin and controller,
ideally working recording system

### August - Refinement Phase:

CW 31: Refine UX & Integrate into other Skins  
CW 32: Enable Import from Serato & explore possibilities for sharing  
CW 33: *Buffer*

Edit Dialog, Auto DJ?)

## Log

### How I work

I tend to branch out to other open source contributions when I want to
work on something - I am almost unable to idle ;)  
Evidence of that are regular reports on GitHub:
<https://github.com/search?q=xerus2000&s=created&type=Issues>  
However, this can also lead to delays in what I was supposed to work on.

I currently use <https://notion.so> to take notes and may link some
pages here as proof of work - but these are personal working areas and
not optimized for general understanding. I will always incorporate
results into this wiki page when appropriate.

### CW 21 & 22

  - Work on general PRs:
    <https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Axerus2000+user%3Amixxxdj+updated%3A2020-05>
  - Code Style discussions (Zulip & PRs)
  - Planning & initial Research:
