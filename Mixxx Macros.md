There are moves through which a DJ expresses himself - and there are
many other, sometimes tedious tasks that need to be done as groundwork.
Instead of having to juggle beatmatching, effects, cues and sliders all
at once, a DJ should be able to rely on his tools so he can focus on
what really matters. For some, beatmatching and keeping all tracks in
sync is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something
happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync
function.  
But sometimes, more sophisticated automation can be helpful - maybe you
want to skip a breakdown, shuffle around verses, loop an intro a
specific way or deliberately repeat certain parts. Handling that while
messing with effects and getting the next track ready can be tricky;
that is where Mixxx Macros come in. With this feature implemented, it
will be possible to record specific moves while playing a track and
store them in a rack, to be used when it gets hot.
