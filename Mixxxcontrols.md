# Controls

Each control inside Mixxx is identified by a unique string. These
strings are used in the keyboard mappings, controller mappings, and
inside Mixxx to gain access to the controls. The following is a list of
controls that can be used in any of the above contexts.

## List of Controls

The default range is 0.0 to 1.0, unless otherwise noted. Binary means
that it is either 'ON' (non-zero) or 'OFF' (zero).

*Please keep the controls in alphabetical order by group*
