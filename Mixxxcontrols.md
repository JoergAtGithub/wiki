## List of Controls

The default range is 0.0 to 1.0, unless otherwise noted. Binary means
that it is either 'ON' (non-zero) or 'OFF' (zero).

*Please keep the controls in alphabetical order within each group.*

### \[Various\]

The following extensions add some features to ControlPotMeter controls
(volume, crossfader, ...). Use in conjunction with \[Channel*N*\],
\[Sampler*N*\], \[Master\] ... groups

### EQs and filters

Starting in Mixxx 2.0, the equalizers and filter controls have been
moved to special [effects units](#effects-framework). The EQs are
controlled by \[EqualizerRack1\_\[Channel*N*\]\_Effect1\] and the filter
knob is controlled by \[QuickEffectRack1\_\[Channel*N*\]\]. Users can
choose between several options for the effects loaded in these racks in
the Equalizers section of the Preferences window.
