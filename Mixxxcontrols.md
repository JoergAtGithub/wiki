# Controls

Each control inside Mixxx is identified by a unique string. These
strings are used in the keyboard mappings, controller mappings, and
inside Mixxx to gain access to the controls. The following is a list of
controls that can be used in any of the above contexts.

## List of Controls

The default range is 0.0 to 1.0, unless otherwise noted. Binary means
it's either on (non-zero) or off (zero.)

*Please keep the controls in alphabetical order by group*

This list contains all of the controls that are useful to MIDI mapping
and skin developers.

If you were so inclined, the full list (with mixed up \[Groups\],
internal objects and other things you shouldn't touch...be warned\!) can
be generated by running the following script in your mixxx/src
directory:

\======

    #!/bin/sh
    # set -x
    IFS='
    '
    last_control=
    
    for ck in `grep ConfigKey *.cpp | sed -e 's/ConfigKey(group/ConfigKey("[Master]"/g' | grep 'ConfigKey("' | grep -v "Channel2" | sed -e 's/.*ConfigKey(//g' -e 's/, */,/g' | cut -d\) -f1 | sed -e 's/\[Channel1\]/\[ChannelN\] (where N is a number 1 or 2)/g' | sort -fu`; do
      control=`echo $ck|cut -d\" -f2`
      if [ "$control" != "$last_control" ]; then
        echo
        echo $control
        last_control=$control
      fi
      key=`echo $ck|cut -d\" -f4`
      if [ ! -z "${key}" ]; then echo "* ${key}"; fi
    done

## Using Controls Inside Mixxx (for developers)

If you want to access one of these controls inside Mixxx, you can do so
with something like this:

``` 
 ControlObjectThreadMain* controlRightPitch = new ControlObjectThreadMain(ControlObject::getControl(ConfigKey("[Channel2]", "rate")));
```

That line will give you a ControlObject which allows you to read and
control the pitch of the right channel in Mixxx. For example, to
increase the pitch of the track in the right channel, one could do
something like this:

``` 
 float fRightPitch = controlRightPitch->get();
 controlRightPitch->slotSet(fRightPitch + 0.10);
```

This would increase the pitch of the right channel inside Mixxx, and the
GUI controls would automatically reflect this change. Access to
ControlObjects is also thread-safe when used this way.

**Important note:** Different types of ControlObject wrappers must be
used depending on what thread your code is running in. This example
assumes the code will run in the GUI (ie. main) thread. The
ControlObjects wrappers should be used as follows:

  - **ControlObjectThreadMain** - GUI (main) thread
  - **ControlObject** - The audio callback thread (most audio processing
    happens here)
  - **ControlObjectThread** - Other threads
