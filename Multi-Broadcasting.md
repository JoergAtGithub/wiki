# Multi-broadcasting

by Stéphane Lepin

**Current State**: phase 1 planning

### Project description

This project for Mixxx aims to add several features potentially useful
for users willing to broadcast live with Mixxx. Two new features will be
implemented : broadcasting profiles and multiple broadcasting outputs.
These features will be implemented in two parts, matching the GSoC
phases schedule.

### Phase 1: Broadcasting profiles

Broadcasting profiles allow management of several sets of server
settings/credentials and encoder settings. These will be managed through
dedicated controls in Mixxx's existing Live Broadcasting preferences UI.
Profiles have the standard Icecast/Shoutcast and encoder settings
currently available in the Live Broadcasting panel.

#### Technical details

  - Profiles are saved as \*.bcp.xml files under a "broadcast\_profiles"
    subdirectory in the settings folder. This file nature is hidden from
    the user, and the profile list in the preferences UI is built by
    listing files in that folder.
  - Create a new BroadcastProfile class:
  - Move all properties from BroadcastSettings to BroadcastProfile
  - The BroadcastProfile class takes care of its
    serialization/deserialization from/to XML, using Qt's built-in XML
    features

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * save() method to save the profile
    * Parameterized constructor or static method to build an instance based on an existing .bcp.xml file
* The XML document generated by an instance of BroadcastProfile has the profile's name as its filename
* Refactor the BroadcastSettings class:
* Move all properties to BroadcastProfile
* Keep a QList of broadcast profiles
* Add a method to fill the QList of broadcast profiles by listing the contents of the "broadcast_profiles" settings subdirectory and call this method in the constructor
* Add a "CurrentProfile" config key to mixxx.cfg through BroadcastSettings. A value for this key is the name of a file under "broadcast_profiles/", without the .bcp.xml extension
* Add a setCurrentProfile() method with an instance of BroadcastProfile as its sole parameter. Calling this will also set the value of CurrentProfile in mixxx.cfg
* Add a getCurrentProfile() method which returns an instance of BroadcastProfile (typically called when streaming starts).
* The Settings UI (DlgPrefBroadcast class) must be refactored to add control over and use of broadcasting profiles
* Add a combo list of profiles
* Selecting a profile loads its settings in the fields of the Live Broadcasting panel
    * It first puts the settings into the previously-selected profile
* Constraint: the current profile can't be changed or edited while streaming is running
* Add buttons to create, delete and rename profiles
* Update the logic of DlgPrefBroadcast to accomodate for the API changes in BroadcastSettings
    * DlgPrefBroadcast Constructor:
      * Clone the instances and list from BroadcastSettings' list of profile. Profile changes from the preferences GUI will be made to these clones.
      * Get the current settings from the current profile 
    * DlgPrefBroadcast::slotApply :
      * Move the clones and list back to BroadcastSettings and save all profiles.
      * Call BroadcastSettings::setCurrentProfile()
    * On Cancel: discard the clones and cloned list, and don't save changes to profiles.
```

### Phase 2: Multiple broadcasting outputs

The new “Live Broadcasting” settings panel will consist of a list of
broadcasting outputs. The existing GUI for Live Broadcasting settings is
to be moved to a dedicated dialog, which will be spawned when the user
clicks on “Edit” next to an item of the outputs list.

*The current Live Broadcasting settings UI will be moved to a dedicated
dialog, instanciable per connection*

#### Technical details

  - The current libshout logic in EngineBroadcast must be separated from
    it and moved to a new class ShoutOutput (with QThread inheritance)
  - Class methods:

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Set broadcasting profile (instance of BroadcastProfile)
    * Start output (overrides QThread::run)
    * Stop output
    * Slot: Push uncompressed audio samples to output
* The EngineBroadcast sidechain filter must be refactored to only act as a "broadcast manager" that receives audio samples and pushes them to output instances
* The settings code must be updated to handle several outputs
* A new Live Broadcasting settings UI must be implemented (see UI mockup above)
* The existing Live Broadcasting settings UI must be moved to an instanciable dialog spawned by an item's "Edit" button in the new Outputs list UI.
* If time allows it:
* Add "server profiles" to allow reuse of server credentials (e.g. : multi-bitrate/multi-codec streaming to the same server)
* Add AAC support for streaming 
    * Encoder: maybe possible with FFmpeg's new built-in aac encoder
    * Libshout support: See [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/726991]]
```

<span class="underline">Possible evolutions</span>:

  - Make the broadcasting code more generic and not specific to
    libshout.
  - Implement Shoutcast 2 support
  - Add an Opus streaming encoder

### Weekly schedule

*Work in progress*

#### Phase 1: Broadcasting profiles

##### May 30 - June 2nd

  - Write the BroadcastProfile class and its XML load/save code
  - Adapt the BroadcastSettings class: move select attributes to
    BroadcastProfile and implement get/set profile code

##### June 5 - June 9

  - Edit the Live Broadcasting UI panel to add the profile select and
    edit widgets
  - Write the logic of the new UI elements:
  - Loading the profile list on instanciation
  - Ability to create, rename and delete profiles
  - On profile selection, put the current form fields into the
    previously-selected profile and fill the form fields with values
    from the newly-selected profile
  - On settings apply, save all profiles

##### June 12 - June 16

  - Testing and bug hunting

##### June 19 - June 28

  - **First milestone: have this feature mergeable**
  - Project planning for Phase 2

#### Phase 2: Multi-broadcasting

To be defined.
