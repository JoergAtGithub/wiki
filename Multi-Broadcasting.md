### Project description

This project for Mixxx aims to add several features potentially useful
for users willing to broadcast live with Mixxx. Two new features will be
implemented : broadcasting profiles and multiple broadcasting outputs.
These features will be implemented in two parts, matching the GSoC
phases schedule.

### Phase 1: Broadcasting profiles

Broadcasting profiles allow management of several sets of server
settings/credentials and encoder settings. These will be managed through
dedicated controls in Mixxx's existing Live Broadcasting preferences UI.
Profiles have the standard Icecast/Shoutcast and encoder settings
currently available in the Live Broadcasting panel.

#### Technical details

  - Profiles are saved as \*.bcp.xml files under a "broadcast\_profiles"
    subdirectory in the settings folder. This file nature is hidden from
    the user, and the profile list in the preferences UI is built by
    listing files in that folder.
  - Create a new BroadcastProfile class:
  - Move all properties from BroadcastSettings to BroadcastProfile
  - The BroadcastProfile class takes care of its
    serialization/deserialization from/to XML, using Qt's built-in XML
    features

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * save() method to save the profile
    * Parameterized constructor or static method to build an instance based on an existing .bcp.xml file
* The XML document generated by an instance of BroadcastProfile has the profile's name as its filename
* Refactor the BroadcastSettings class:
* Move all properties to BroadcastProfile
* Keep a QList of broadcast profiles
* Add a method to fill the QList of broadcast profiles by listing the contents of the "broadcast_profiles" settings subdirectory and call this method in the constructor
* Add a "CurrentProfile" config key to mixxx.cfg through BroadcastSettings. A value for this key is the name of a file under "broadcast_profiles/", without the .bcp.xml extension
* Add a setCurrentProfile() method with an instance of BroadcastProfile as its sole parameter. Calling this will also set the value of CurrentProfile in mixxx.cfg
* Add a getCurrentProfile() method which returns an instance of BroadcastProfile (typically called when streaming starts).
* The Settings UI (DlgPrefBroadcast class) must be refactored to add control over and use of broadcasting profiles
```

**TODO:** Implement password encryption (see
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1642765>)

### Phase 2: Multiple broadcasting outputs

The new “Live Broadcasting” settings panel will consist of a list of
broadcasting outputs, with the existing settings form under the
connections table. Editing a connection profile will be made through the
refactored existing UI.

*The current Live Broadcasting settings UI will be moved to a dedicated
dialog, instanciable per connection*

#### Technical details

  - The current libshout logic in EngineBroadcast must be separated from
    it and moved to a new class ShoutOutput (with QThread inheritance)
  - Class methods:

<!-- end list -->

``` 
    * Set broadcasting profile (instance of BroadcastProfile)
    * Start output (overrides QThread::run)
    * Stop output
    * Slot: Push uncompressed audio samples to output
* The EngineBroadcast sidechain filter must be refactored to only act as a "broadcast manager" that receives audio samples and pushes them to output instances
* The settings code must be updated to handle several outputs
* A new Live Broadcasting settings UI must be implemented (see UI mockup above)
* The existing Live Broadcasting settings UI must be moved to an instanciable dialog spawned by an item's "Edit" button in the new Outputs list UI.
* If time allows it:
* Add "server profiles" to allow reuse of server credentials (e.g. : multi-bitrate/multi-codec streaming to the same server)
* Add AAC support for streaming 
    * Encoder: maybe possible with FFmpeg's new built-in aac encoder
    * Libshout support: See [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/726991]]
```

<span class="underline">Possible evolutions</span>:

  - Make the broadcasting code more generic and not specific to
    libshout.
  - Implement Shoutcast 2 support
  - Add an Opus streaming encoder

### Weekly reports

#### Week 1: May 30th - June 2th

I wrote the implementation for the BroadcastProfile class: it currently
has its XML load/save code that needs to be tested and the get/set
behaviour of settings is a bit different compared to the settings
management in BroadcastSettings: settings get/set methods in
BroadcastSettings (that will be removed) "directly talk" with the
mixxx.cfg file, while BroadcastProfile stores values temporarily in
private members until save() is called to write the values to the
profile's XML file. Also, methods beginning with "getDefault" don't
exist in BroadcastProfile because these are set on instanciation of the
class.

I got a bit late because of dev setup issues on my Windows system: I
tried to work on Mixxx with Eclipse on Windows by using the build.bat
provided in the Windows Dev Setup guide from the wiki. Building works,
cleaning too (with a small addition to the Batch script) but Eclipse's
"code checker" throws a lot of errors about undefined symbols (for the
record: include paths for Qt and Mixxx's source code where added in the
project's settings, along with appropriate search paths). In the end, I
switched to Qt Creator, and it suits me for now.

For the next week of coding, I expect to have results on the XML
profiles load/save mechanisms and UI by Friday.

#### Week 2: June 5 - June 9

I refactored BroadcastSettings as a manager of BroadcastProfile
instances. It's integrated in the current UI, which saves settings to a
file named "Default Profile.bcp.xml" in
$SETTINGS\_DIR/broadcast\_profiles.

Actual implementation of BroadcastProfile differs a bit from the
original design: file management (create/rename/delete/open) was
initially planned to be done in a profile instance itself, but was
eventually moved to BroadcastSettings to have this responsibility
handled in a single class instead of several parts across several
classes. However, the XML save/load code is still the responsibility of
BroadcastProfile.

I got late with UI, so next week's plan is:

  - First, make sure BroadcastSettings is instancianted only once
  - Replace instances in DlgPrefBroadcast and EngineBroadcast with a
    pointer to a single instance
  - Work on UI from Monday to Wednesday
  - Testing during the remaining days.

#### Week 3: June 12 - June 16

I had progress on the UI but there was still a lot of work left to do to
make sure everything is functioning properly. Instead of implementing
the new Broadcasting Profiles UI, Daniel and I agreed on a slimmed-down
schedule for the remaining of phase 1. The plan is to focus on the XML
profile subsystem to have a good foundation for multiple broadcasting
outputs (a.k.a multi-broadcasting, each profile being a connection) for
phase 2, with proper instance reference passing and unit tests. See
[this Pull Request](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1283).

The UI will be left untouched, and the work already done is kept
separately for later re-use.

#### Week 4: June 19 - June 23

*Work in Progress*
