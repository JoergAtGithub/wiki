The Native Instruments Traktor Kontrol S2 Mk2 is a 2 deck all-in-one controller with an integrated audio interface. It has a pair of balanced 1/4" TRS outputs and a pair of unbalanced RCA outputs which both output the main mix, a 1/4" TRS headphone jack, and a 1/4" TRS microphone input. The microphone input is digitized and available to the computer for recording and broadcasting.

The Kontrol S2 Mk2 can be distinguished from the Mk1 by the jog wheels. The top of the jog wheels on the Mk2 are shiny aluminum; the top of the jog wheels on the Mk1 are black. The S2 Mk3 does not have effects knobs at the top.
