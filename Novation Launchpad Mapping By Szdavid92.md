# Mixxx mapping for Novation Launchpad ðŸ¦„

**Flexible and (soon) customizable controller mapping for Launchpad.
Make DJing with Mixxx fun on Launchpad\!**

There's already a Launchpad mapping shipping with Mixxx however it has
several quirks and limitations:

  - it has a single hardcoded layout, supporting only the first 2 decks.
    You can't e.g. change to decks 3 and 4, or sampler decks. This
    painfully limits usability especially if you have multiple
    Launchpads (as I do\!) and want to control more decks.
  - It would be better if the deck layout was customizable. This is a
    problem that crops up as you add support for sampler decks. E.g.
    when you play samplers, a small 4x4 interface with only hotcues is
    ideal.
  - Some of the controls are broken on recent Mixxx.
  - It has a mixer interface, but why? Launchpad is really not fit for
    mixing.
  - 8 of the buttons have no mapping, what a waste of resources\!

So I decided to make one that is more stable, flexible and
customizable\!

## Features âœ¨

  - map from 1 up to 4 channels (decks or samplers) on a single
    Launchpad at the same time âœ¨
  - utilize presets with multiple sizes and features, change between
    them with ease ðŸ¦„
  - x5 different deck presets in 3 sizes created for you and ready to
    use âœ¨, make it easy for the user to create new presets for their own
    needs (coming soon\!)
  - rich arsenal of controls ðŸ¦„
  - play, cue, hotcues
  - loop controls, beatloop, beatjump
  - sync/master, tap, pitch shift
  - custom controls like bouncy jumps
  - and much more...
  - trigger-like controls are favored - no clumsy mixers and faders âœ¨
  - library navigation ðŸ¦„
  - LED lights mimic Mixxx UI âœ¨

## User guide

### Global controls

Global controls consist of **Deck selectors**, **Library controls** and
**Modifier keys**.

**Deck selectors** are located on the top bar. They are used to select
decks and samplers to be laid out on the main grid. *D1-D4* are mapped
to corresponding *decks*, *S1-S4* to *samplers*.

**Library controls** are located on the sidebar to the right. They
occupy the upper 5 buttons. Their functions from top to bottom:

  - up in the library sidebar
  - down in the library sidebar
  - expand/close selected library sidebar entry
  - up a track
  - down a track

> Note: The up/down controls are autoscrolled. If you hold them down for
> longer, the scrolling activates. This comes in handy when navigating
> lengthy playlists.

[[/media/docs/lp-mki-layout.png|layout]]

**Modifier keys** are located on the lower 2 buttons of the sidebar, and
used for the same purpose as you would expect on a computer keyboard.

The figures show Shift in **bold**, Ctrl in *italic*, Ctrl+Shift in
***bold italic***.

> Note: For some controls the modifier keys will act like toggles, but
> the modifier keys themselves are never toggled globally.

### Using the deck selectors

The deck selector is an essential feature of this Launchpad mapping.
With it you can map multiple presets in multiple layouts on the main
grid. The main grid is the inner 8x8 grid on the Launchpad. You have to
memorize the layout patterns, but don't worry, there are only 4 of them.

To select a single channel, simply press the button corresponding to the
channel. This will remove all existing selections, and find the largest
default preset that can be fit on the main grid.

Presets come in 3 different sizes: *short* (4x4), *tall* (4x8) and
*grande* (8x8)<sup>1</sup>. Multiple presets can have the same size, but
only one preset can be default per size.

To select multiple channels to be laid out, press the corresponding
buttons in a *chord*. This way you can select to 4 channels.

So what is a chord? In a chord you press buttons so you only release the
first after you pressed the last one. The order of presses matter,
however the order of releases does not. Now, instead of writing down how
the exact layout algorithm works, I just show you the four different
layouts that is generated for 1 (single channel), 2, 3 and 4 note
chords. Once more the algorithm will fill out the spaces with the
largest default preset.

| [[/media/docs/lp-1.png|1]] | [[/media/docs/lp-2.png|2]] |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| [[/media/docs/lp-3.png|3]] | [[/media/docs/lp-4.png|4]] |

This means that e.g. if you press down D3-D2-S1 in this chord sequence,
- D3 will be mapped to block 1 with the default tall preset, - D2 will
be mapped to block 2 with the default short preset and - S1 will be
mapped to block 3 with the default short preset.

Now you might ask: "But what if I don't want to use the largest default
preset?"

After a channel has been laid out you can cycle between all the presets
that can fit into its space. This won't reflow the layout, even if you
end up using a smaller preset. To cycle between presets - press Ctrl +
Channel Selector to cycle forward, - press Shift + Channel Selector to
cycle backward or - press Ctrl + Shift + Channel Selector to revert to
default.

The cycling order is the following: - primary: large to small -
secondary: default then all others in fixed but not specified order.

See, not that complicated after all. Let's see the actual presets that
are featured out of the box:

|        | default                                                                            |                                                                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| grande | [[/media/docs/lp-mki-grande.png|grande]] **GRANDE** is currently the only grande layout. |                                                                                               |
| tall   | [[/media/docs/lp-mki-tall.png|tall]] **TALL** is the default tall layout.                | [[/media/docs/lp-mki-juggler.png|juggler]] **JUGGLER** is a tall layout optimized for beat jumping. |
| short  | [[/media/docs/lp-mki-short.png|short]] **SHORT** is the default short layout.            | [[/media/docs/lp-mki-sampler.png|sampler]] **SAMPLER** is an all-cue short layout for samplers.     |

    \> Interface \> Cue mode*
  - **ctrl**: sets cue at cursor

Feedback

  - **bright red**: display dictated by your Cue mode

#### TAP

tap tempo for playback or beatgrid.

  - **normal**: tapping adjusts song playback tempo. You should have
    correctly detected BPM and beatgrid.
  - **ctrl**: ~~instead of altering the playback tempo, tapping adjusts
    the beatgrid.~~ Not implemented. *Why?*
  - **shift**: sets the gridlines so the nearest beat aligns to current
    play position
  - **ctrl+shift**: second button: sets the gridlines so the nearest
    beat lines up with the other track's nearest beat

top. While pressed, they modify the key of the track. When pressing
multiple, the one later pressed *steals* the modification.

#### LOAD/EJECT

Controls

  - **normal**: load the selected library track on deck. To prevent
    accidentally hitting, only works when the deck is empty.
  - **ctrl**: load the selected library track on deck. Works when the
    deck is not playing.

#### HOTCUES

Hotcues are bound from left to right, bottom to top.

Controls

  - **normal**: activates the hotcue:
  - if the hotcue is set, seeks the player to hotcue's position.
  - if the hotcue is not set, sets the hotcue to the current play
    position
  - **ctrl**:
  - if the hotcue is set, deletes the hotcue
  - if the hotcue is not set, sets the hotcue to the current play
    position

Feedback

  - **bright yellow**: hotcue enabled
  - **blank**: hotcue disabled

#### BEATJUMPS

Controls for jumping backward (lower lane) and forward (upper lane).
Supports two modes: - the **normal mode** is represented with bright
color. Jumping works as you would expect. - the **rebouncing mode** is
shown with dim color. It jumps on attack, then jumps back on release.
Jumping legato works and uses the same stealing algorithm as key
shifting. Modes are switched with the CH MODE control (pressing `ctrl`
and `shift` at the same time)

You can change modes by pressing **ctrl+shift+\[any beatjump key\]**.

There are two sets of jumps, switchable with the `ctrl` and `shift`
keys, and shown in their corresponding colors. This means that pressing
**ctrl+\[any beatjump key\]** will switch to the first set, while
pressing **shift+\[any beatjump key\]** will switch to the second set.

#### BEATLOOPS

Controls for setting beatloops.

Controls

  - **normal**: toggles beatloop

Feedback

  - **bright red**: beatloop enabled
  - **dim red**: beatloop disabled

#### LOOPJUMPS

Almost the same as beatjumps, only instead of changing the current play
position, they translate the position of the loop markers. As beatjumps,
they support two modes and two sets. On how to use these, see
[Beatjumps](#beatjumps)

#### HALVE / DOUBLE

They halve / double the current loop length, modifying the position of
the end marker.

#### LOOPJUMP SMALL

They translate the loop markers by a small amount backward/forward.

Controls

  - **normal**: translates loop backward/forward

#### LOOP

Works the same way as the LOOP button on the GUI, ie. it toggles the
current loop on or off.

Controls

  - **normal**: toggles loop on/off

Feedback

  - **bright green**: loop on
  - **dim green**: loop off
