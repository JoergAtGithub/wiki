This device is not USB MIDI class compliant. Its signals are translated
to MIDI by special drivers on Windows and Mac OS X. There is no driver
available for Linux. It has been discontinued in favor of the [Novation
Launchpad Mk2](Novation%20Launchpad%20Mk2) which is USB MIDI class
compliant and has RGB pads.
