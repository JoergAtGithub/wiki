[[/media/hardware/novation_twitch.png|novation\_twitch.png]]

A mapping for the Novation Twitch will be included in Mixxx 2.1. You can
use it now with Mixxx 2.0 by saving the following files to your
[controller mapping file locations\#user controller mapping
folder](controller%20mapping%20file%20locations#user%20controller%20mapping%20folder):

  - [JS
    file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/master/res/controllers/novation_twitch.mixco.output.js)
  - [XML
    file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/master/res/controllers/novation_twitch.mixco.output.midi.xml)

The mapping was made with the [Mixco mapping
framework](https://sinusoid.es/mixco/) and [documentation for the
mapping](https://sinusoid.es/mixco/script/novation_twitch.mixco.html) is
available on the Mixco website.

Support for the device was added to Linux in Linux 3.10. If you are
using an older version of Linux you will need to upgrade.
