# Customisation

The XML file is a modification of the Numark NS7 provided with Mixxx
1.10.0 Mac (10.6.x) and modified using the Midi wizard.

I remove several parameters related to the original file and not suited
to the DJ2GO, but not (yet) all

I made some choices related to my preferences:

  - Pitch - of each channel has been mapped to Low filter (on / off)
  - Pitch + of each channel has been mapped to Low filter (on / off)
  - Cue of each channel has been mapped to Flanger (on / off)
