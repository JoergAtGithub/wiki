# Customisation

The XML file is a modification of the Numark NS7 provided with Mixxx
1.10.0 Mac (10.6.x) and modified using the Midi wizard.

I removed several parameters related to the original file and not suited
to the DJ2GO, but not (yet) all

I made some choices related to my preferences:

  - Pitch - of each channel has been mapped to Low filter (on / off)
  - Pitch + of each channel has been mapped to High filter (on / off)
  - Cue of each channel has been mapped to Flanger (on / off)

The XML file is available [in a former revision of this
page](http://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/numark_dj2go?rev=1339948598);
[this forum thread indicates it is now easy to use the
wizard](http://mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=7388&p=26421&hilit=dj2go#p26421).
