The Numark iDJ Live II is a budget MIDI controller similar to the
[Discover DJ](ion_discover_dj). It does not have a built in sound card,
so a [splitter cable](hardware_compatibility#splitter_cables) or
[separate sound card](hardware_compatibility#usb_sound_cards) is
required to use headphones with it.

## Compatibility

This controller is USB MIDI class compliant, so it is plug-and-play on
all platforms without having to install any special drivers. Tested only
on Mac so far.

## Button mapping

Most of the mapping is self-explanatory and matches up to labels in the
Mixxx UI.

### Play/cue/sync buttons

Despite their appearance, the cue buttons don't seem to have LEDs. Only
the play and sync buttons do.

The "SET" buttons set the cue point and the arrow buttons jump to the
cue point. They do not change behavior depending on whether the track is
playing or paused.

### Jog wheels and scratch button

The scratch button in the middle changes the mode of the jog wheels.
When the scratch LED is off, you can use the wheels to adjust the pitch
of a playing track, or to quickly search through a paused track. The
search mode moves exactly 32 beats for each revolution of the jog wheel.

### Browse knob

The browse knob scrolls through your library, and the 1 and 2 buttons
below it load a track into the corresponding deck. Pressing down on the
Browse knob toggles fullscreen library view.
