This controller as the same as the [Numark Mixtrack
Pro](Numark%20Mixtrack%20Pro) but without a built-in sound card. It has
been discontinued and succeeded by the [Numark Mixtrack
3](Numark%20Mixtrack%20Pro%203).

# Support in Mixxx

## Releases Vs. Updates?

As of Mixxx 1.8.2, the Numark Mixtrack is fully supported. The
community-made controller mapping and backing script is regularly
updated to take the remarks and improvements into account. Which can be
found in the [corresponding forum
thread](http://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1808&start=30#p10182).

## Mapping

**The mapping is very similar like VirtualDJ software work with this
controller.**

### The jogs

#### Not in scratch mode

When not in scratch mode, touching the jogs won't pause the song.
Turning them will slightly adjust the tempo, which will resume slowly to
its speed. This slowness to resume is somehow equivalent to what you
would expect from drivebelt turntables. I hate it, and I have not found
a way to correct it... This is why I mostly mix using the pitch bend
buttons, which allow for an instant resume to the "pitch slider
assigned" pitch for the track.

#### In scratch mode

In scratch mode, touching the jogs will pause the song. The jogs are
very sensitive, and allow for scratching and launching tracks on a given
moments when "cueing them in your headphones". Be very careful with
this: never remain in scratch mode if not needed, you will touch the
jogs by error and put your tracks out of sync because one has pause, or
worse, produce a "blank".

## Known problems

  - The effect control not work like Virtual DJ software.
  - The jog not work with the same sensibility of Virtual DJ.
