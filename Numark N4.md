This mapping features full 4-deck support and seamless integration of
external devices.

This mapping has some unusual features like per Deck shift buttons and
multiple pages of hotcues. [[/media/hardware/numark/n4_traktor_overlay.svg|]]

This overlay can be downloaded in a ready to print format for DIN
[[/media/hardware/numark/numarkn4-mixxx-overlay-a3.pdf|A3]] and
[[/media/hardware/numark/numarkn4-mixxx-overlay-a4.pdf|A4]] printers.

## Troubleshooting

### The only Mapping for the N4 I have works completely different

This is probably due to your Mixxx version not being up-to-date or this
mapping not being merged yet. You can download the mapping directly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1647).
