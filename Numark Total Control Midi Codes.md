# MIDI Codes

Here we document what MIDI packets you can expect from the [Numark Total
Control](Numark%20Total%20Control) surface, as well as what packets you
can send to do various things.

The Numark Total Control does not have labelled controls. (All labels
are on removable/swapable face cards.) In lieu of a diagram, we will
refer to an individual control by column number, then the number from
the top. Thus, for example, control 8X3 is the lower of the rightmost
pair of knobs. 5X4 is the center knob. Etc..

Messages sent by the Numark Total Control will be send over MIDI channel
1. Messages sent to the Numark Total Control may be sent over any MIDI
channel.

## Buttons, Knobs, and Sliders

Numark Total Control will send either 0x90 (Note On) messages or 0xB0
(CC) messages for every control on the control surface.

Some CC controls are absolute, and others are relative. Absolute
controls will report an absolute position from 0 to 127. Relative
controls will report a change in position from -63 to 63.

Button presses will result in two events, one for press and one for
release. Oddly, although Numark Total Control sends a Note On message
for button presses, it does not send a Note Off message for button
release. Instead, button presses are Note On messages with a velocity of
127, and button releases are Note On messages with a velocity of 0.

## LED Lights (Status Indicators)

Most buttons, knobs, and sliders on the Numark Total Control are
designed to light up.

LEDs are lit by sending a 0x90 (Note On) message with a non-zero
velocity to the appropriate note number. LEDs are turned off by either
sending a 0x80 (Note Off) message (any velocity) *or* by sending a 0x90
(Note On) message with a zero velocity.

While most testing was done on MIDI channel one, the Numark Total
Control seems to respond to LED commands on any channel.
