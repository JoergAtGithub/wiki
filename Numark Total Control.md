## Numark Total Control Support in Mixxx

The Numark Total Control is now supported in Mixxx. If your version of
Mixxx doesn't already have a MIDI mapping for the Numark Total Control,
get [the MIDI
mapping](http://alexmarkley.com/code/mixxx/midi/Numark%20Total%20Control.midi.xml)
now\! (Note that you'll need a version of Mixxx more recent than
1.6.0beta4, otherwise things might not work right.) For details about
how to use this MIDI map, please see the comments within the XML file
itself.

Since the Total Control uses swappable label cards, you may wish to
customize this MIDI map or replace it entirely. For information about
this MIDI mapping format, see [MIDI Controller Mapping File
Format](MIDI%20Controller%20Mapping%20File%20Format). For
reverse-engineered information about Numark Total Control's MIDI codes,
see [Numark Total Control MIDI
Codes](Numark%20Total%20Control%20MIDI%20Codes).
