#### Notes about (in)compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Tested with Mixxx 2.2.3 (build 2.2 r6750) on Linux Ubuntu 18.04LTS and
macOS Catalina 10.15.4

Should probably work flawlessly with Windows too (not tested).

USB class compliant

#### Notes about any features of the controller that are not (yet) supported in Mixxx

#### Any special instructions required for using the controller with Mixxx

Nothing beyond the usual loading of the mapping in Mixxx's preferences.

#### The inputs and outputs of the audio interface

Just configuring channels 1-2 for master and channels 3-4 for headphones

#### An explanation of how the mapping works

Scratching feature has been added to take advantage of the touch
capacity of the jog wheels of the controller.
