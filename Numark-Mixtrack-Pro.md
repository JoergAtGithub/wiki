## Known problems

  - The pitch on the controller has a very short run. Thus, having it
    configured as a +10/-10 (or more) is tricky because you will get a
    very low pitch precision. Configuring it as +8/-8 (Mk2 style) is
    higly recommended.
  - Each slide/knob needs to be moved on Mixxx startup to match levels
    with the Mixxx UI.
