Most of these projects are much too big for an internship.  We should figure out ways to make them smaller.

## Preferences redesign

Lots of UX testing

## AutoDJ rewrite

Too big on its own.  Can we identify particular parts of autodj that an intern could work on?

## Manual overhaul

## Video tutorials

## Screenreader UX

Owen thinks this would be a good project, it could mostly be filing bugs and figuring out common issues we're having

## Touchscreen UX

## Community Manager / Social Media

"Community Manager" is a real job, not an internship project.  But an intern could work with Owen on some of these aspects and help give mixxx more of a presence.
