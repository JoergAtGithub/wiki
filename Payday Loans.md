Today **[payday loans](http://www.maketodaypayday.co.uk)** are easy
means of getting money, but for some reasons you might be receiving
harrasing calls from your **loan** company. Well,the best thing you can
do is not to bark back at the call but be formal and descent though. Ask
for extension to pay the **PAYDAY LOAN** you have made and make sure it
is not a short term loan that is only payable for two weeks, which you
have actually closed a deal with.

Another is you can write a formal letter to the lending extending your
apology for not be able to pay the **[payday
loans](http://www.maketodaypayday.co.uk)** on time and a request to stop
the call. Some **payday loans** company are friendly, however, when the
harrasing call for your **loan** does not stop, keep a record of the
call for you can also counter sue for a harrasment case. But do not
allow such loan to reach this kind of stage. Pay your loan even just a
little during pay day.
