Crossfade GNU/Linux allows you to use a USB drive with your music
collection to DJ on any modern PC (with an x86 or x86\_64 CPU),
including Apple Macs, using the DJ program Mixxx customized however you
like. USB drives with Crossfade GNU/Linux installed on them show up in
Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux as normal USB drives that music or any
other data can be copied onto. Unlike ordinary USB drives, they can also
be used to boot Crossfade GNU/Linux. After rebooting, the PC will be
back to how it was before. See the manual for [installation
instructions](http://nongnu.org/crossfade/crossfade-manual.html#installation).

Crossfade GNU/Linux is setup with a realtime Linux kernel for optimal
performance. It includes the Xfce graphical desktop environment, Midori
web browser, and Clementine music player. It has a number of other
programs for live musical performance including the Hydrogen drum
machine, SooperLooper and Giada loopers, Guitarix electric guitar
amplifier, Rakarrak guitar effects board, Ardour digital audio
workstation, Audacity wave editor, and many LV2 and LADSPA audio effects
plugins. Additionally, Crossfade GNU/Linux includes utilities that make
it useful as a computer rescue system, such as the GParted partition
manager, GNU GRUB bootloader, TestDisk data recovery program, FSArchiver
filesystem backup program, and MATE Disk Usage Analyzer. Crossfade
GNU/Linux is a FedoraÂ® Remix containing software from sources other than
Fedora, namely RPMFusion and PlanetCCRMA, as well as scripts and
configuration specific to Crossfade GNU/Linux.

## DidJiX

DidJiX has the bare necessities to DJ with Mixxx. It boots straight to
Mixxx without a graphical desktop environment. Download the ISO image
and either burn it to a CD or *cat* it to a USB drive (this will erase
the content of the drive).

Based on Arch.
