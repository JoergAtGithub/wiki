# Mixxx QA Procedure

This page details how the Mixxx team goes about ensuring that Mixxx
releases continue to improve and integrate new features with fewer bugs.

This procedure is in development as it has been virtually non-existent
up until now.

## Mixxx Release Checklists

These checklists are a step-by-step procedure for testing Mixxx

checklists.
