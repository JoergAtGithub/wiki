The **Reloop Beatmix 2** is a performance-oriented 2-channel pad
controller with integrated soundcard. **Beatmix 2** offers an
ergonomically designed 2-channel mixer layout, optimized for the club
allowing you to work intuitively: Dedicated equalizer and gain dials,
high-quality line-faders, an extremely smooth-running crossfader, 16
multi-colour drum pads, as well as two extensive FX units are the
foundation for your creativity.

This controller is a midi and audio class compliant device so it is
compatible as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, on Windows, the
manufacturer ship an ASIO low-latency driver that can be found on the
[Manufacturer's product page](http://www.reloop.com/reloop-beatmix-4).

Mapping for the [Reloop Beatmix 4](reloop_beatmix_4) should be
compatible with this controller, but haven't been tested. See the
[Reloop Beatmix 4](reloop_beatmix_4) page for the complete mapping
description.
