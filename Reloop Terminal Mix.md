The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 use the same mapping in
Mixxx.

## Sound hardware

The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 have integrated
multichannel sound cards.

**Inputs**  
Both have a microphone and a switchable line/phono input that can be
routed into Mixxx. The Microphone jack is the front side of the
controller, the RCA line jacks are at the back next to the line/phono
switch.  
For both inputs there is a gain knob and a switch on the controller's
front side that toggles between routing the signal to the computer
(`SW`) or mixing it directly with the master output (`MST`).  
`MST` allows to play music from external sources without any software,
for example while setting up Mixxx software. Switch to `SW` if you want
to use the line signal for vinyl control or AUX input, or if you want to
record the microphone input with Mixxx, broadcast it, or put on effects.

**Outputs**  
At the front, there are two headphone jacks (1/8" and 1/4"), both
affected by the hard-wired `TONE` knob.  
At the back, there are unbalanced outputs for booth and master (RCA), as
well as a balanced master output (1/4").  
The output level of both master ouputs, booth and headphone outputs are
all controlled by respective hard-wired knobs in the center column which
can't be mapped to software.

## Mapping options

We have provided the following customization variables at the top of the
script you can set to your liking:

1.  **pitchRanges**: Set the pitch slider range each time you toggle it.

Just open the `controllers/Reloop Terminal Mix 2-4.js` file in your
favorite text editor and you'll see these variables right near the top.
Edit & save and Mixxx will automatically reload the preset.

## Deck controls

*The controls are the same on both sides of the controller. The left
side controls Deck 1 or 3 and the right side controls Deck 2 or 4.*

  - **Range** button - Toggles the pitch slider range. (See [Mapping
    Options](https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/reloop_terminal_mix#mapping_options))
  - **Keylock** button - Toggles key lock. \[ToDo: map long-press to
    reset track key\]

### FX Controls

Mapping](Standard%20Effects%20Mapping) via components-js to control the
FX units.  
Note: these knobs & buttons don't switch to decks 3 and 4.

    (considering the pitch slider) and playback continues as soon as the
    wheel is released. Open the `controllers/Reloop Terminal Mix 2-4.js`
    file and look for `TerminalMix.brake` to adjust parameters.

Move the cross-fader to smoothly fade between the decks assigned to
either side.

#### Deck assign

*(Terminal Mix 4 only)* Use the four switches on the front of the unit
to choose on which side of the cross fader that deck will be heard.
(Note that the fader-start functionality correctly follows this
assignment.) If "thru" is selected, the cross-fader will not affect the
audio from that deck and it will always be heared.

#### Curve adjust

Use the knob to adjust the curve from a smooth fade to a fast cut.

*The remaining controls on the front of the unit adjust hardware
parameters and are not MIDI-mappable.*
