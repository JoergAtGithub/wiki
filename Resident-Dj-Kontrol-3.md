This DJ controller includes a 2 channel sound card with balanced XLR
outputs (+ unbalanced RCA) and a microphone input. This controller works
with USB cable connected only, but for better stability, it's recommend
to use the external 5V 1A Poweradapter as well.

It seems that this controller is equivalent to the JBSystems DJ-kontrol
3 controller. [JB Systems dj-kontrol 3](jbsystems_dj-kontrol_3)

Please follow the Link to the JB Systems DJ-kontrol 3 and test this
mapping. This is NOT tested with this Resident controller. But they look
exactly (technical) the same (only other colors).

If it is not working, please reply
