The Roland DJ-202 is an all-in-one USB MIDI controller with a built in
sound card. It has controls for 2 decks that can be toggled between
decks to play with 4 decks. As a special feature it's got an in-built
sequencer with 8 sounds from the TR-808 and the TR-909 drum machines
(TR-606 and TR-707 are available via firmware update).

## Drivers

### Windows & MacOS

You can download the latest drivers and firmware from
<https://www.roland.com/global/products/dj-202/downloads/>.

### Linux

The DJ-202 is a USB class compliant MIDI and audio device, so it's
plug-and-play on Linux.

#### Enabling generic mode

If the device is not properly detected as a MIDI device, you need to
enable generic mode in the system settings:

1.  Hold \[LOAD\] Button when plugging in the USB cable until the
    sequencer start/stop button blinks
2.  Press \[R channel performance pad 1\]
3.  Turn the rotary selector left, so only the upper left corner of the
    master level indicator is lit
4.  Press the blinking start/stop button
5.  Wait until all pads light up, then disconnect USB cable
