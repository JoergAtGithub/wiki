The Roland DJ-505 is an all-in-one USB MIDI controller with an
integrated audio interface. It has controls for 2 decks that can be
toggled between decks to play with 4 decks. It also features a TR-S step
sequencer with sounds from the TR-808 and the TR-909 drum machines
(TR-606 and TR-707 are available via firmware update).

## Drivers

You can download the latest Windows & MacOS drivers and firmware from
the [manufacturer's
website](https://www.roland.com/global/products/dj-505/downloads/).
Since the DJ-505 is a USB class compliant MIDI and audio device, the
device is plug-and-play on Linux.

## Controller Mapping

A mapping is currently being developed and [can be found on
GitHub](https://github.com/Holzhaus/mixxx/tree/roland-dj-505-mapping).

The mapping relies on the following channel assignments (for Line/Phono
input support, applying effects to the TR-S output, etc.):

| Output Channels | Assigned to |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| 1-2             | Master      |
| 2-3             | Headphones  |

| Input Channels        | Assigned to |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| 1-2 (CH 1 Line/Phono) | Aux 1       |
| 3-4 (CH 2 Line/Phono) | Aux 2       |
| 7-8 (TR-S output)     | Aux 3       |
