## "She Thinks My Decks Are Sexy"

Open-source songwriting ^\_^

*This is another random act of silliness precipitated by comments in
IRC. It would be fun to have this recorded in time for a release as a
promo track.* So first, we must write lyrics\! Add wherever you can, but
try to match the number of syllables to the original line.

If you have an alternate idea for something already written, add another
column to the table so we can vote later.

*(Music & original lyrics Â©1999 by Jim Collins and Paul Overstreet.
Original performance by Kenny Chesney.)* If you haven't heard it before,

| .    | Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun                     |
| .    | Over by the gate lordy here she comes                          |
| .    | With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea  |
| .    | I make a little room and she climbs on up                      |
| .    | Open up a throttle and stir a little dust                      |
| .    | Just look at her face she ain't a foolin me                    |
| .    |                                                                |
| .    | She thinks my tractor's sexy                                   |
| .    | It really turns her on                                         |
| .    | She's always staring at me                                     |
| .    | While I'm chuggin along                                        |
| .    | She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land |
| .    | She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan                 |
| .    | She's the only one who really understands what gets me         |
| .    | She thinks my tractor's sexy                                   |
| .    |                                                                |
| .    | We ride back and forth until we run out of light               |
| .    | Take it to the barn put it up for the night                    |
| .    | Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on            |
| .    | She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is              |
| .    | She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids                |
| .    | One more teeny weeny ride before take her home                 |
| .    |                                                                |
| .    | She thinks my tractor's sexy                                   |
| .    | It really turns her on                                         |
| .    | She's always staring at me                                     |

| .    | Well she ain't into cars or pick up trucks                     |
| .    | But if it runs like a Deere man her eyes light up              |
| .    |                                                                |
