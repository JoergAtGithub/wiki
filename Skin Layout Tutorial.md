## Getting started

A Mixxx skin is just a folder with various text files and images. The
text files define what widgets\[1\] will be part of the skin, as well as
its properties, such as position and size. The images are used by Mixxx
to represent widgets on screen\[2\], so you can completely customize how
a knob looks by drawing the appropriate image with a graphics editor.

The skin.xml defines all the elements (widgets) of the skin, what the
images are used for and and where they are placed on screen.
