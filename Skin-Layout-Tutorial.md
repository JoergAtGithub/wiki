# Skin layout tutorial

This is a step by step tutorial that will get you through the basics of
creating a Mixxx skin. For extended information on skin creation see
[Advanced skin techniques](advanced_skin_techniques).

You are going to create a simple skin called **Minimal** that will end

## Getting started

A Mixxx skin is just a folder with various text files and images. The
text files define what widgets\[1\] will be part of the skin, as well as
its properties, such as position and size. They are written in
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), see [Introduction to
XML](Introduction%20to%20XML) if you are not familiar with the language.
The images are used by Mixxx to represent widgets on screen\[2\], so you
can for example completely customize how a knob looks by drawing the
appropriate image with a graphics editor.

To create your skin the first thing you have to do is create the skin
folder in the [Mixxx resource folder](Mixxx-resource-folder.md) and
name it **Minimal**, which is the name of the skin.
