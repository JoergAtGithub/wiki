**GSoC 2009 Note:** Due to a lack of time our core developers will be
able to dedicate to Mixxx this Summer, **Mixxx will not be participating
in GSoC 2009**. This page contains documentation from GSoC 2008.

This page collects some introductory information which we hope will be
of use to our students, especially during the community bonding phase of
GSoC 2008.

## Mixxx

As you all already know, Mixxx is a cross-platform DJing application
which recreates in software many of the features of a traditional
hardware DJing setup.

### History

Mixxx was originally written by Tue Haste Andersen and Ken Haste
Andersen in 2002 partly as a research project into user interface design
for Tue's PhD. The project continued to develop until some time around
2004 when Tue moved on to full-time employment and no longer had time to
manage the project. Although development continued, there were no new
releases and Mixxx drifted somewhat in this period until early 2006 when
Adam Davison became the lead developer and released Mixxx 1.5.0. For the
last 2 years, the project has been steadily growing leading up to our
inclusion in Summer of Code for the first time last year.

### Technical Info

Mixxx was designed with a strong focus on cross-platform portability.
**Qt** gives us a very strong cross-platform graphics toolkit and has
additional benefits like a thorough set of portable data structure
implementations (eg. QMap, QList, etc.). Mixxx was originally written
using Qt 3, but during the summer of 2007, Mixxx was ported to Qt 4. At
the same time, we moved away from a custom qmake-based build system,
instead opting for SCONS. **SCONS** is a python-based build system that
has easy syntax, and is still very powerful. Our single `SConscript`
file (in the "src" directory) checks all of our dependencies and builds
Mixxx on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

New experimental (and potentially unstable) features are coded such that
they are only enabled when they are turned on at compile-time. For
example, during its development, recording was turned on by compiling
with `scons recording=1`. Now that recording is stable and reasonably
well tested, the compile flag has disappeared and it is always built
into Mixxx. For a full list of build flags, run `scons ----help`

One of our goals is to minimize the amount of platform-specific code we
have. Before we moved our audio core to **PortAudio**, we had separate
backend for ALSA, CoreAudio, ASIO, WMME, etc. This is a losing strategy
for several reasons:

1.  Our code base was inflated by a factor of X.
2.  If we wanted to add new features (eg. multiple soundcard support),
    it was going to require modifying 5 different audio backends.
    Furthermore, nobody has the time/energy/computers to test Windows,
    OS X, and Linux implementations of stuff.

By switching to PortAudio, the platform-specific audio code moves to an
external library, our audio core is now much more flexible and any
improvements we make to PortAudio will be of benefit to the whole open
source community. Currently, our MIDI code still has three different
backends (Windows, CoreMidi, and ALSA-seq), although creating a single
PortMidi-based backend is something we will consider in the future.

## People

As with any project, there are some names which you will see. Here's a
list of some:

### Mentor Team in Alphabetical Order

  - Garth Dahlstrom - Long-time Mixxx contributor (since Mixxx
    1.4.something). Most active on Hercules device support on Linux
    (libDJConsole)/Windows(MIDI), various interface tweaks, and
    occasional build script tweaks. Has a Hercules Mk2 and a Hercules
    RMX console, both do MIDI on Windows.
  - Adam Davison - Lead developer and organisation admin for GSoC. Knows
    about Windows development, MIDI control, skins and probably some
    other stuff he can't remember now.
  - Albert Santoni - Has written loads of code for Mixxx. Knows about
    Mac/Linux development, wrote the scons build system, vinyl control
    and more.

Albert and Garth are based in Canada (EST -5), while Adam can be found
in either London or Geneva (GMT +0 or CET +1 respectively).

On IRC, Garth is jumpkick, Albert is asantoni, Adam is adam\_d.

### Other Notables in No Good Order

  - Tue and Ken Haste Andersen - As mentioned above, the original
    authors of Mixxx, no longer with the project.
  - Adam Bellinson/DJ Thread - Long time Mixxx user, does a weekly live
    show with Mixxx over on dnbradio.com
  - John Sully - Contributor since Spring 2007, wrote recording, new EQ
    code, improved VU meters, and more.
  - Pawe≈Ç Bartkiewicz - SoC student from last year, implemented LADSPA
    support in Mixxx

    Mixxx
  - Nathan Prado - The final 2007 SoC student, worked on the library
    interface
  - Mark Hills/radiomark - Author of xwax, an open source vinyl control
    project which Mixxx relies on

## Managing Expectations

When you enter the work world, you'll hear managers drone-on about how
with better communication all the bad things that happened could have
been avoided.

Its only partially true... Problems are almost assured to crop up from
time to time. To be really successful in handling them, you must also
include how you deal with the people you report to and the clients you
provide service to in your approach to solving them. \[In this case
mentors and the community of Mixxx users\]. This is called *managing
expectations*.

### Some Advice for Students

  - Take the initiative. Don't sit around waiting for someone to ask you
    if you need help. If you are stuck, make an effort to understand the
    problem so you can ask good questions, then ask... ask the Google,
    ask the wiki, ask on IRC, ask a mentor, ask the mixxx-devel mailing
    list.
  - We expect you to encounter problems, all of the mentors are here to
    help all the students, so please bug us.
  - Try to set realistic goals and timelines for yourself. This comes
    with experince, knowing the code base and the problem domain.
    (Mentors should try to help with this.)
  - Over-communicate rather then under-communicate.
  - Help each other out. We are all on the same team. Everyone will
    pass/fail on their own, but we want everyone to pass big time (we
    hope to get some amazing contributions from all of you).
  - Feel free to dabble in other parts of Mixxx that interest you. Don't
    feel confined to just your project scope. Remember though, that you
    will be evaluated on your project's progress.

You've been selected because you presented great proposals, you've got
the skills to pull them off and because we sense in each of you a
passion for Music/DJing.

### What Mentors Should Be Doing For You

You all have an assigned mentor, he has the following responsibilities:

  - Having contact with you at least once a week (during the coding
    phase at least) to get a progress update - any problems, what
    happened last week, what's planned for the week coming up
  - Evaluating your progress for Google
  - Getting to know you and being your first point of contact for any
    more personal issues you may encounter

In the highly unlikely event that you have a problem with your assigned
mentor, you should attempt to discuss it with them. Should this fail,
Adam Davison is the organisation administrator and will deal with any
such matters in confidence. If Adam is your mentor, you're screwed...
just kidding :) you can speak to any other member of the mentoring team
if you feel more comfortable.

In addition to this, **you will be getting support from all 3 mentors**.
Each member of the mentoring team has different expertise, different
insights and not least of all different timezones. The whole team will
do the following:

  - Help students find solutions to problems, brainstorming, offer
    suggestions: approaches, better coding style, optimizations, etc...
  - Offer feedback on patches
  - ???
  - Profit\!

Up to a point, the more people that you discuss a technical issue with,
the better. **The recommended ways for having technical discussions are
in \#mixxx on IRC or on mixxx-devel**

## Some First Activities

You're probably wondering what exactly you can do in the community
bonding phase. Here is a list of things:

  - The absolutely first thing you should do, as soon as possible, is
    sign up to the mixxx-devel mailing list and briefly introduce
    yourself to the broader community; who you are, where you are based
    out of, what your IRC nick is and what you are working on for
    GSoC... 
  - You will also want to find an opportunity to have a chat either on
    IRC or by e-mail, with your mentor, especially to let him know your
    commitments and schedule over the next couple of months.
  - Have a browse through at least some, if not all, of the sources of
    information listed in the Community Resources section below.
  - Sign up to to become a wiki editor
  - Discuss your plans and designs with the community, people may well
    be able to suggest things you haven't thought of, or offer possible
    refinements
  - Check out the code base from
    [SVN](https://mixxx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mixxx/trunk/mixxx)
  - Try building Mixxx - if you are building on a Debian/Ubuntu flavour
    of Linux check out these [Wiki](compiling_on_linux)
    [pages](compiling_on_an_asus_eeepc), if you are on Windows [check
    here](http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/HowtoBuildWin32),
    or on OSX [check here](compiling_on_os_x)
  - Check out the [developer tools](developer_tools) page

We understand that many of you will have varying levels of school
commitments over the next few weeks but you should try to do as many of
these things as possible, this will leave you in an excellent position
to start work as soon as the coding phases begin.

## Community Resources

There are a bunch of places where you can interact with the Mixxx
community, here's a list of the main ones:

  - [mixxx-devel](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel)
    - This mailing list is the centre of all development related
    discussion. You should all subscribe here:
    <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel>, right
    away if you haven't already.
  - [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mixxx) - More immediate than
    mixxx-devel if the right person is available, \#mixxx on freenode
    although I think you've all been there already
  - [Wiki](http://mixxx.org/wiki/) - A small but growing collection of
    useful documentation. You should definitely add to it if you learn
    things that aren't already written here.
  - [Forum](http://www.mixxx.org/forums/) - We now have a brand new
    forum which will hopefully grow and bring the user community closer
    to the development team over the next few months, have a browse
    here: <http://www.mixxx.org/forums/>
  - [Blog](http://mixxxblog.blogspot.com) - Irregular articles about
    Mixxx development progress: <http://mixxxblog.blogspot.com>
