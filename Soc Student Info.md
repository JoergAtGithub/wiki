This page collects some introductory information which we hope will be
of use to our students.

## Mixxx

As you all already know, Mixxx is a cross-platform DJing application
which recreates in software many of the features of a traditional
hardware DJing setup.

### History

Mixxx was originally written by Tue Haste Andersen and Ken Haste
Andersen in 2002 partly as a research project into user interface design
for Tue's PhD. The project continued to develop until some time around
2004 when Tue moved on to full-time employment and no longer had time to
manage the project. Although development continued, there were no new
releases and Mixxx drifted somewhat in this period until early 2006 when
Adam Davison became the lead developer and released Mixxx 1.5.0. For the
last 2 years, the project has been steadily growing leading up to our
inclusion in Summer of Code for the first time last year.
