# Supported sound file format test grid

This grid is just used for verifying functionality of supported sound
file formats in the next version of Mixxx.

Currently reporting for: **Mixxx 1.7.0-beta1**

**Simply state *yes* or *no* for formats you've tested.** If any do not
work correctly or at all, please report a bug containing the file
format, sample rate, bit depth, number of channels (stereo/mono,) and OS
to [our bug tracker](https://launchpad.net/mixxx/+filebug). (If you can
include a sample file, that would also be helpful.)
