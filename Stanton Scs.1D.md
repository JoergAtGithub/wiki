## Latest MIDI mapping & script files

#### Instructions

**Stanton's DaRouter is not used with Mixxx 1.9.0 and up. Close it
before starting Mixxx.**

1.  Download the files for the applicable version of Mixxx below.
2.  Save the files into:

<!-- end list -->

  - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Mixxx\midi` (technically
    `%PROGRAMFILES%\Mixxx\midi`)
  - OS X: `/Applications/Mixxx.app/Contents/Resources/midi`
  - Linux: `/usr[/local]/share/mixxx/midi`

<!-- end list -->

1.  Turn the controller on.
2.  Start Mixxx
3.  Open Preferences
4.  Expand "MIDI Controllers"
5.  Select the "Stanton SCS.1d" device
6.  Click the Enable checkbox in the right pane
7.  Click the drop-down and choose the "Stanton SCS.1d" mapping
8.  Click OK and you're good to go. (The controller should initialize,
    light up and stop spinning.)

### 1.9.x

**Important: Make sure your unit(s) are at firmware v1.25 or higher** so
that the platter and flashing lights on deck changes work correctly.
[See Stanton's SCS.1d page
here](http://www.stantondj.com/stanton-controllers-systems/scs1d.html)
and click Downloads.

***Note:** the controller is not yet supported in Linux. We have a plan
to fix that in a future Mixxx version.*

*The mapping shipped with Mixxx v1.9.0 was unfinished. Download the
updated one below.*
