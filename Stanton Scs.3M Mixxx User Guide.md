# Stanton SCS.3m & Mixxx User Guide

This guide explains how the SCS.3m is mapped by default in Mixxx.

[[/media/hardware/stantonscs/scs3m_main.png|]]

The left side of the controller controls deck 1. The right side is for
deck 2. We'll walk through the controller from top to bottom and explain
the features.

## Deck select buttons

These are used only as modifier buttons in Mixxx for now. Hold them down
to access different functions for that side of the controller (Deck A/C
for the left side virtual deck 1, Deck B/D for the right side, deck 2,)
detailed for each control below.

## Top horizontal sliders

These adjust the pitch control.

  - Touching near the edges will do a temporary pitch bend in that
    direction.
  - Hold the current mode button down (EQ/FX) and touch the slider on
    that side to reset it to 0%.
  - Hold the applicable Deck select button down when using these sliders
    to perform fine-grained pitch adjustment.

When the Master button is held down:

  - The left slider adjusts the Pre/Main headphone mix
  - The right slider adjusts Master Balance
  - Also hold the current mode button and touch the slider on that side
    to reset it to center

## FX/EQ sliders

From left to right, for each side:

  - in EQ mode these adjust Low, Mid, and High frequency filters
  - in FX mode these adjust Depth, Delay, and LFO for the flanging
    effect

Hold down the current mode button (FX/EQ) and touch one of these sliders
to reset it to center.

## FX/EQ mode buttons

Press these to choose what the sliders above them control. (See above.)

  - Hold Deck and press FX to toggle the flange effect for that deck
  - Hold Deck and press EQ to auto-adjust the pitch to sync the BPM on
    this deck with the other one (assuming it was detected correctly on
    both)

## Volume sliders

These adjust the channel volume as on a traditional mixer.

  - Holding Deck causes these to adjust the pre-fader gain for the deck

When the Master button is held down:

  - The left slider adjusts the Headphone volume
  - The right slider adjusts Master volume

## Soft buttons

From top to bottom on both sides:

  - Reverse/rewind
  - Fast forward
  - Cue
  - Play

Headphone buttons toggle that deck in the headphone mix.

## Cross-fader

Adjusts the cross-fade between the virtual decks

  - Needle drop function: Hold a Deck button to use the cross-fader
    strip to search through the track loaded on that deck

## VU Meters

These normally show the pre-fader signal for the respective deck.

  - When holding down the Master button, they show the stereo master
    output meters: left side for the left channel, right side for the
    right channel.

**NOTE:** The LEDs are calibrated to the VU meters on-screen. If you see
a red LED flicker, <span class="underline">you are clipping</span> and
need to reduce the volume or gain to avoid distorted sound and/or
speaker damage.
