# Stanton SCS.3m & Mixxx User Guide

This guide explains how the SCS.3m is mapped by default in Mixxx.

[[/media/hardware/stantonscs/scs3m_main.png|]]

The left side of the controller controls deck 1. The right side is for
deck 2. We'll walk through the controller from top to bottom and explain
the features.

## Deck select buttons

These are used only as modifier buttons in Mixxx for now. Hold them down
to access different functions for that side of the controller (Deck A/C
for the left side virtual deck 1, Deck B/D for the right side, deck 2,)
detailed for each control below.

## Top horizontal sliders

These adjust the pitch control.

  - Touching near the edges will do a temporary pitch bend in that
    direction.
  - Hold the current mode button down (EQ/FX) and touch the slider to
    reset it to 0%.
  - Hold the applicable Deck select button down when using these sliders
    to perform fine-grained pitch adjustment.

## FX/EQ sliders

From left to right

  - in EQ mode these adjust Low, Mid, and High frequency filters
  - in FX mode these adjust Depth, Delay, and LFO for the flanging
    effect

Hold down the current mode button (FX/EQ) and touch one of these sliders
to reset it to center.

## WIP

\- Deck + FX = toggle flanger - Deck + EQ = sync - Deck + vol slider =
Gain - Deck + Cross-fader = Needle drop
