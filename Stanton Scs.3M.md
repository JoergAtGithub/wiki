# Mapping description

The left side of the controller controls deck 1. The right side is for
deck 2. We'll walk through the controller from top to bottom and explain
the features.

## Deck select buttons

These are used only as modifier buttons in Mixxx for now. Hold them down
to access different functions for that side of the controller (Deck A/C
for the left side virtual deck 1, Deck B/D for the right side, deck 2,)
detailed for each control below.

## Top horizontal sliders

These adjust the pitch control.

  - Touching near the edges will do a temporary pitch bend in that
    direction.
  - Hold the current mode button down (EQ/FX) and touch the slider on
    that side to reset it to 0%.
  - Hold the applicable Deck select button down when using these sliders
    to perform fine-grained pitch adjustment.

When the Master button is held down:

  - The left slider adjusts the Pre/Main headphone mix
  - The right slider adjusts Master Balance
  - Also hold the current mode button and touch the slider on that side
    to reset it to center

## FX/EQ sliders

From left to right, for each side:

  - in EQ mode these adjust Low, Mid, and High frequency filters
  - in FX mode these adjust Depth, Delay, and LFO for the flanging
    effect

Hold down the current mode button (FX/EQ) and touch one of these sliders
to reset it to center.

## FX/EQ mode buttons

Press these to choose what the sliders above them control. (See above.)

  - Hold Deck and press FX to toggle the flange effect for that deck
  - Hold Deck and press EQ to auto-adjust the pitch to sync the BPM on
    this deck with the other one (assuming it was detected correctly on
    both)

## Volume sliders

These adjust the channel volume as on a traditional mixer.

  - Holding Deck causes these to adjust the pre-fader gain for the deck

When the Master button is held down:

  - The left slider adjusts the Headphone volume
  - The right slider adjusts Master volume

## Soft buttons

From top to bottom on both sides:

  - Rewind
  - Fast forward
  - Cue
  - Play

Headphone buttons toggle that deck in the headphone mix.

## Cross-fader

Adjusts the cross-fade between the virtual decks

  - Needle drop function: Hold a Deck button to use the cross-fader
    strip to search through the track loaded on that deck

## VU Meters

These normally show the pre-fader signal for the respective deck.

  - When holding down the Master button, they show the stereo master
    output meters: left side for the left channel, right side for the
    right channel.

**NOTE:** The LEDs are calibrated to the VU meters on-screen. If you see
a red LED flicker, <span class="underline">you are clipping</span> and
need to reduce the volume or gain to avoid distorted sound and/or
speaker damage.
