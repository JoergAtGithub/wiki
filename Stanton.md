# Stanton hardware controllers in Mixxx

Muchas gracias go to The Stanton Group (<http://www.stantondj.com>) for
helping us add support for their hardware\!

Devices fully supported:

  - [Stanton SCS.3d](Stanton%20SCS.3d)

Devices for which support is in the works:

  - [Stanton SCS.1m](Stanton%20SCS.1m)
  - [Stanton SCS.1d](Stanton%20SCS.1d)

(Through the use of Stanton's DaRouter software, these devices can be
used to a reasonable extent in any version of Mixxx that supports MIDI
input.)
