# Stanton hardware controllers in Mixxx

Muchas gracias go to The Stanton Group (<http://www.stantondj.com>) for
helping us add support for their hardware\!

Devices fully and natively supported:

  - [Stanton SCS.3d](Stanton-SCS.3d.md)

Devices for which native support is in the works:

  - [Stanton SCS.1m](Stanton-SCS.1m.md)
  - [Stanton SCS.1d](Stanton-SCS.1d.md)

(Through the use of Stanton's DaRouter software, these devices can be
used to a reasonable extent in any version of Mixxx that supports MIDI
input.)
