# Tips on Submitting Patches

  - Try to follow the [Coding Guidelines](Coding%20Guidelines)
  - Keep your patches simple. If you changed lots of stuff, split it up
    into smaller patches to make it easier for us to review. There's an
    [excellent
    justification](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Simple_Patches) for
    this over on the [Bugzilla
    site](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Simple_Patches).
  - Send them to our [developer's mailing list
    (mixxx-devel)](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mixxx-devel).
    Patches get reviewed quicker when there's more people looking at
    them. This also gives us a means of discussing patches.
