# Supported MIDI controller test grid

This grid is just used for verifying functionality of supported
controllers in the next version of Mixxx.

Currently reporting for: **Mixxx 1.7.0-beta1**

**Simply state *works* or *doesn't work* for controllers you've
tested.** If it doesn't work, please fix it using the following
information:

  - [MIDI controller mapping file
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format)
  - [MIDI Scripting](MIDI%20Scripting) if needed for tuning or complex
    behaviors

Otherwise report the reasons for not working to the mixxx-devel mailing
list.
