# Supported MIDI controller test grid

This grid is just used for verifying functionality of supported
controllers in the next version of Mixxx.

Currently reporting for: **Mixxx 1.8.0**

**Simply state *works* or *doesn't work* for controllers you've
tested.** If any buttons/sliders do not work as expected within Mixxx's
existing functionality, please fix them using the following information:

  - [MIDI controller mapping file
    format](midi_controller_mapping_file_format)
  - [MIDI Scripting](MIDI-Scripting.md) if needed for tuning or complex
    behaviors

Otherwise report the reasons for not working to [our bug
tracker](https://launchpad.net/mixxx/+filebug).

(For details on a particular controller, please visit the [hardware
compatibility](hardware%20compatibility) page.)
