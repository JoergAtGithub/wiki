This page is designed to collect minimum system requirements for Mixxx.
This is quite a difficult process because you can usually get some
degree of performance/stability out of Mixxx on pretty much any system,
it all depends on how low a latency you want to achieve.

Everyone can help fill in the table, this is how to do it:

1.  Check Mixxx is stable with the setup you're using
    1.  Lets define stable as you've tested it and heard no sound
        glitches for 10-20 minutes
2.  Find the right entry(ies) for your system
    1.  First look in the table for your version
    2.  Figure out which latency band(s) you're in (i.e. a machine
        running at 36ms counts as \< 100ms and \< 50ms)
    3.  Find your operating system
3.  If your computer is slower than the one already in the box, then
    replace the current entry with the details of your own system

If you find that say you have a slower CPU but better sound card then do
something sensible like make one of the machines a footnote. If we find
that performance is significantly different between Vista and XP or
Intel and PPC macs or something then we'll have to make more columns I
guess.
