# Problem

Mixxx 1.11 don't works very well on touch screen devices. This was
reported in some bugs like

  - [\#1152572 MultiTouch compatibility and
    features](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1152572) 
  - [\#1217738 rotary dial control via touchscreen is
    wrong](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1217738) 
  - [\#1217733 right-click solution or replacement needed for
    touchscreens](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1217733)

These bug reports are containing many details and further lings, but are
cluttered due to the post style. So here now brief overview.

## OS level touch to mouse solution

All three OS's are offering a native touch to mouse converter. It is
required to be able to use legacy application which are not able to
receive original touch events. The right click is generated by some kind
gesture. It is only a single pointing device emulated to achieve maximum
compatibility. Unfortunately these solutions are optimized for common
standard widgets. Mixxx on the other side does not use standard widgets.
The Mixxx widgets are designed to behave as close possible like hardware
Midi controls. The main difference here is that Mixxx buttons are
emitting without delay on the push event while normal GUI buttons are
emitting on release event. This way we have not time to detect a right
click gesture without delaying the left click.

Here an overview to the different native right click solutions:

**Windows 8**

  - Right click = Releasing after long push 

**Ubuntu**

  - Right click = long push 
  - Right click = Two finger click 

**iOs**

  - Right click = long push
