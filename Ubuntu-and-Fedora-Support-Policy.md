We explicit offer support for Fedora (RPM) and Ubuntu (DEB) with the latest stable Mixxx version.  

As the original package maintainer only update security fixes of the Mixxx version shipped with the distro, it will soon fall out of our support. Because of this we run: 
* Mixx PPA https://launchpad.net/~mixxx/+archive/mixxx
* RPM Fusion repository https://admin.rpmfusion.org/pkgdb/package/free/mixxx/
 
This way users have the choice to subscribe for updates and keep their Mixxx installation supported. 

Appart from the recommended stable Mixxx version, users have also the choice to follow the beta stream which is a preview for the next stable version or the alpha (nightly) stream which is under active development. This way he can help to find bugs an contribute ideas for upcoming Mixxx versions. 

We aim to provide the current stable version for all active distro versions. Sometimes new Mixxx features require distro facilities that are not available in older distro version. In these cases we can't effort to keep these old version updated and we drop the support. 
Every user is encouraged to update his distro to go back to the supported state.   

Luckily this is not the case for Mixx 2.2.4, the current version at the time of writing. 

For Mixxx 2.3.0 we will drop Ubuntu Xenial support, because of the missing C++17 support.
