## "Unbreak My Code"

Open-source songwriting ^\_^

*This is a random act of silliness precipitated by comments Albert made
while working on Mixxx. While we're waiting for bug reports on the beta,
it would be fun to have this recorded in time for the 1.7.0 final
release as a promo track.* So first, we must write lyrics\! Add wherever
you can, but try to match the number of syllables to the original line.
The nice thing is that many of the original lines apply unchanged to
programming\! LOL

If you have an alternate idea for something already written, add another
column to the table so we can vote later.

| I'm hanging my head in shame                         | Don't leave me in all this pain                   |
| you caught me with b-z-r blame                       | Don't leave me out in the rain                    |
| .                                                    | Come back and bring back my smile                 |
| .                                                    | Come and take these tears away                    |

| When you gave me that err'r                          | When you walked out the door                      |
| And refused to rebuild                               | And walked out of my life                         |
| Un-cry these tears                                   | Un-cry these tears                                |
| I cried so many nights                               | I cried so many nights                            |

| .                                                    | Time is so unkind                                 |
| And life is so cruel with seg-men-ta-tion faults now | And life is so cruel without you here beside me   |
