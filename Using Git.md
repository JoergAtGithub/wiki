# Using Git for Mixxx Development

Mixxx uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for source control. Git is a
distributed version control system that allows us to develop, share, and
maintain code easily. For code hosting, we use
[GitHub](https://github.com).

# Installing Git

You need to install Git to work with the Mixxx Git repository.

## Debian / Ubuntu

Install the `git` package from the software center or install it from
the command-line using `apt-get`.

    sudo apt-get install git

## Windows

<http://git-scm.com/downloads> Download and install git from
[git-scm.org](http://git-scm.com/downloads/).

We recommend using [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/)
on Windows since using the terminal on Windows is a giant pain.

## OS X

Download and install git from
[git-scm.org](http://git-scm.com/downloads/).

Alternatively, you may install it from a package manager for OS X such
as [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) or
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

This is typically as easy as typing:

``` 
brew install git 
```

In a terminal.
