The VCI-300 is a dedicated USB MIDI controller. It also comes with a
built in audio interface with standard 4-in/4-out and headphone
connection, which means all you need for DJing is the VCI-300, a laptop
and a set of headphones.

#### Differences VCI-300 to VCI-300MKII

In 2010 Vestax made changes to the original VCI-300 that improved the
controller. AFAIK there were <span class="underline">no</span> changes
in the Midi mapping.

1.  **Volume Boost (Gain Boost)**

<!-- end list -->

  - Higher output gain level and headphone volume level when supplying
    power with the optional power adaptor.
  - <span class="underline">Important Note:</span> Optional power supply
    DC-7 must be used in order to get the boost on the headphones and
    Master output. Without the power supply the MKII will perform just
    like the original VCI-300. Also, using the DC-7 on the original
    VCI-300 will do nothing.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Optional Vestax Digital Fader (not included)**

<!-- end list -->

  - The VCI-300MKII Cross fader can be upgraded to Vestax's new magnetic
    sensor system digital fader CF-X2.

<!-- end list -->

1.  \*\*New Direct Audio Thru \*\*

<!-- end list -->

  - Audio fed to the MIC/AUX input can now be directly sent to the
    Master outputs with the THRU switch turned ON, minimizing latency of
    when fed through ITCH.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **New adjust knobs for the JOG sensor control**

<!-- end list -->

  - New JOG sensor adjust knobs for speedy and accurate adjustments.the
    VCI-300MKII's JOG wheels have excellent tracking ability,and
    flexibility for various play styles.You can control songs with
    analog precision.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **New Mini Head-Phone Jack**

<!-- end list -->

  - 1/8 inch headphone connection along with standard 1/4 inch
    connection.
