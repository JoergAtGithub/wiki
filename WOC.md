## This Year (2025)

We offer two projects: 

### Key Colors for Rate Slider

The Mixxx Rate Slider can change a track's key (when Keylock is off).
This project will add color-coded hints along the slider to show the
key the track will shift to at different slider positions.

* Mentor: @danferns
* Skills: First year programming

### Key Tuning

Mixxx does not show tuning information of tracks, which makes harmonic mixing difficult in case of non 440 Hz tuning.
The project will integrate a tuning detector and show tuning information in the library.

* Mentor: @daschuer
* Skills: First year programming and SQL

### Individual Project 

In additionyou may offer your own project or select one or two of these projects:
